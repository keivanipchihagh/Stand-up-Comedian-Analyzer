       "'intro fade the music out let’s roll hold there lights do the lights thank you thank you very much i appreciate that i don’t necessarily agree with you but i appreciate very much well this is a nice place this is easily the nicest place for many miles in every direction that’s how you compliment a building and shit on a town with one sentence it is odd around here as i was driving here there doesn’t seem to be any difference between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here people just kind of walk in the middle of the road i love traveling and seeing all the different parts of the country i live in new york i live in a there’s no value to your doing that at all the old lady and the dog i live i live in new york i always like there’s this old lady in my neighborhood and she’s always walking her dog she’s always just she’s very old she just stands there just being old and the dog just fights gravity every day just the two of them it’s really the dog’s got a cloudy eye and she’s got a cloudy eye and they just stand there looking at the street in two dimensions together and and she’s always wearing like this old sweater dress i guess it was a sweater when she was like ’ but now it’s just like this sweater and her legs are her legs are a nightmare they’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out her legs are awful i saw a guy with no legs wheeling by and he was like yecch no thank you i do not want those i’d rather just have air down here like i have than to look down at that shit i see these two all the time and i always look at them and i always think god i hope she dies first i do i hope she dies first for her sake because i don’t want her to lose the dog i don’t think she’ll be able to handle it if she dies if the old lady dies first i’m not worried about the dog because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady this dog is aware of three inches around his head he’s living in twosecond increments the second he’s in and the one he just left is all he knows about but if he dies this lady she’s gonna be destroyed because this dog is all she has and i know he’s all she has because she has him there’s no if she had one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning were to say good morning gladys she’d be like good and just flush him down the toilet just poom poom the dog just keeps bumping on the drain poom  she gives up ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life ppp poom my daughter likes fish you ever flush a pet down the toilet i had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet i came home the fish was dead she wasn’t home from school yet so i just flushed the fish and that’s a weird moment too ’cause fish live in water so you put it in the toilet floats to the bottom like yeah he’s dead and then you flush and it looks like he goes wait a second aw shit i was taking a nap jesus you gotta be in constant motion to get any respect in this house and then my daughter comes home why did he die da come on what am i gonna say why did he die because who gives a shit that’s the reason that’s the actual reason is because didn’t matter that he was alive that’s why he’s dead he didn’t know his name and he didn’t love you back these are the facts about that fish’s life my daughter likes fish we took her to the aquarium i took both my kids to the aquarium in boston and we were looking at this seal or sea lion i don’t know which one i don’t care i don’t think they need to be separate things i really don’t they don’t care and we don’t care there’s like three scientists who give a shit what we call all those things the scientists could go on tv tomorrow and say ok everybody from now on seals and sea lions and walruses andyou know whatpenguins are all seals now and we would all be like yeah all right fine yes whatever man anyway so we’re looking at this sealsea lion thing and he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas and he’s going they’re really disgusting in person most animals are when you really see them you ever go to a farm you think you’re gonna see little white sheep going baa but they’re all fat and shitcolored and they’re like jesus that thing is awful anyway seals don’t go they go my daughter’s like what is he saying i don’t know i’m a slave kill me the food chain must be awful to be other kinds of stuff you know i’m glad i’m this this is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives anything else any other kind of thing you’re in the food chain you’re in the food we are out of the food chain i don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact that we got out of the food chain that is a massive upgrade because for every other living thing life ends by being eaten that’s how all life ends is every single life except human life every life ends like this aah aah aah we’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed just i love you bye i mean imagine if we were still in the food chain on top of everything else imagine if we were in the food chain it would just be another thing you gotta deal with you’re already having a bad day you wake in up in the morning you’re making breakfast you burn your toast and it’s too late to try again and your kid comes in and says beh and you’re like fine and it’s just why you get a thing in the mail that says that your phone’s different and your mortgage is another company now what i don’t get it then you’re walking to work like why do i even bother shit goddamn it there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station stop it you think that sharks do you think that sharks would be embarrassed if they knew that we could all see their fins sticking out the top of the water i think they’d be bummed ’cause i don’t think sharks are aware of that at all i think sharks think they’re slick they swim around like hey nobody has any idea what’s down here and we’re all up here like there’s totally a shark right there it wouldn’t be fun being a predator either if you’re a predator imagine if every time you’re hungry you gotta chase a guy who’s running for his life you gotta come on dude shit get over here and just hold him down and bite his neck till he shuts the fuck up for a minute so you can just sit there and eat his stomach before you go to work that would really suck that’s why animals just they go let’s do this together man you chase the parents away i am gonna eat the kid and you circle back that’s why they do it like that fuck it i’m eating babies this is bullshit grownups ain’t worth the meat whoops all right all right shit goddamn it idiot this isn’t a gay voice by the way it’s not shut up yeah courtyard confrontation i live in new york city and it’s ok there i live in a nice building i never lived in a nice place before when i was growing up i had no money i mean my mom didn’t didn’t matter i was a child but i’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice there’s like a pretty courtyard with flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing i don’t know what is it with fountains like all fountain sculptors are pedophiles basically you can’t get a fountain made without can you make me a fountain yes i’ll get started right away yes yes it’s finished and it’s just little boys pissing on the face of a greek god that looks like him a lot just piss on me forever anyway there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building and my first week in the building about a year ago i went down to the courtyard for the first time and i didn’t look too good you know it was a sunday morning that’s my least presentable hour there’s a lot of you know just stains just like you know food and me and whatever… and so i’m sitting there so shut up ha ha ha anyway but so there i was i’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard and feeling a little out of place you know there’s these fancy doormen and stuff and then there’s this guy looking at me i notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard and he’s all spiffylooking he’s got brown shoes and he’s looking at me like  i can tell he was thinking i don’t live in the building he thinks i just wandered in off the streets and sat in the courtyard i can tell he’s thinking of coming over and dealing with me on his own and i’m sitting there thinking like please do that yes please come on come on come on come on come on and i’m trying to look even more gross and i’m like pulling up my shirt  and then i see him go no that’s not gonna do at all and he comes over to me  and i’m like num num num i’m so excited to have this thing a confrontation where i’m not wrong at all and he thinks i am rrgh so he comes over says excuse me do you live in this building and i said no ’cause why not start there i said no he goes well then what are you doing here and i said i just need to rest i’m having a hard time he says this is private property and i said well i don’t really believe in that you know just the worst things i could say from his point of view is basically all the things i was saying and he goes well if you don’t leave i’m gonna talk to the doorman i was like can i just stay like five more hours so he’sno and he goes over to the doorman and i see him talking about me to the doorman like this and then i see the doorman going no that guy lives here it’s ok and the look on his face mwah mwah num num it was just so it was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion it’s like i had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings that’s how excited i was getting what ‘old’ is i’m  now so i’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a notsohealthy life i don’t know which one i won’t know till it’s over where this was i don’t know how long i’m gonna live i don’t know nobody knows i guess i think human life expectancy is pretty good we get a good run you know some people die early you know if i die now people will be like that’s too bad if i die five years from now they’ll be like well all right like it’s not even it’s like as soon as you’re  you’re a candidate you know there’s no candlelight vigils for yearold guys that die and you start pushing you know some people get to be like   you know there are people that get to like  and then they’re in the news and it’s always some old guy i met napoleon no you didn’t you liar you oldest liar in the world but  you know you’re not old yet but you start having moments where you kind of start getting what old is especially if you didn’t take care of yourself you know i have moments where i’m like wow this seems early for this like this is something that happens to me a lot i’ll be sitting watching tv or doing nothing and all of a sudden i’ll realize i need to wipe my ass right now i mean nothing happened but i really gotta wipe my ass right now right now gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass how does this happen already i’m  already my asshole’s just like just  my asshole my asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms just kinda… loose and ineffectual my asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up it’s just sitting on the lawn full and open puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind some kid kicks it over on his way home from a tough day at middle school rats that’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole here’s another thing about my age right now if i’m ok say i’m sitting down if i’m sitting anywhere whichha ha ha i love sitting so much i would take sitting and doing nothing to standing and fucking any day this is way better than coming this is way better this is what at my age if i’m sitting down and somebody tells me i need to get up and go to another room i need to be told all the information why first you gotta explain all that shit to me what why do i no why though your car is being towed right now well that’s what happens to me then that’s i accept that ’cause getting up is a whole thing it means first i have to decide do i really want to be alive anymore like let’s start with that and then i gotta  start kind of rocking to get momentum  like i’m trying to get an old honda out of a snow bank shit putting on socks the worst part of my day worst part of every day of my life is when i have to put on my socks putting on my socks is the worst part of every day and it always will be even if i have a terrible day in the future where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother if that ever happened to me the worst part of that day will be when i put on my socks because putting on my socks that means i have to here’s what i have to do i have to get my hands past my pointed toe i don’t even know how i do it i’m sitting here i don’t know how i do that it’s ’cause you have to it’s like folding a bowling ball in half soon as i start i can feel i’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs and i just feel all the systems failing beep beep beep and i have to like lay on my back like an eightyearold and go like this and i start passing out and i know other people’s lives are hard ha ha ha i know i saw an interview on tv with michael j fox and he has parkinson’s and he was describing brushing his teeth and he said it takes him two hours a day and he said it’s agony and i saw this and i thought ok that’s hard that is hard and so is putting on my socks sorry michael doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing tell you what i’ll help you brush your teeth you help me with the socks if you’re older you’re smarter i don’t know i like getting older though life is an education and if you’re older you’re smarter i just believe that if you’re in an argument with somebody and they’re older than you you should listen to them it doesn’t mean they’re right it means that even if they’re wrong their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have they’ve been there longer if you’re older you’re smarter how many people here by applause are  or older  or older applaud ok that’s about  people out of  here’s the interesting thing there’s way more i can see you there’s so many more this is arizona there are way more people in that demographic but they didn’t clap why ’cause they’re smart they’re sitting in the dark going i don’t have to clap i don’t have to do anything they’re not doing it and they’re right you know why ’cause never identify yourself never are you crazy you don’t know why i’m asking how do you know what ok burn them all burn everybody over  how do you know i’m not gonna do that how many people here by applause are  or younger  or younger applaud that’s every time whoo whoo every time that is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here that’s like going to a cancer ward not me whoo i don’t have it i don’t have it if you’re older you’re smarter a yearold garbage man is a million times smarter than a yearold with three phds especially smarter than him ’cause this idiot has been thinking about three things for like  years he’s worthless the garbage man is  he’s had some experience things have happened to him he went to cape cod one summer he saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool he took a bus to montreal he got a hand job at a fair… from a miner i mean a miner not a minor a miner you understand a miner a grown man who works in a mine with dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair that’s what i’m saying happened to the yearold you see he’s had some experience he knows more more has happened to him he’s seen more he’s seen history he’s witnessed history even if it’s not ancient history he saw nixon resign on live television me and those few people that clapped we saw the president of america cry and then quit being the president that shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next today people are like the president’s kind of disappointing really our president wept like an insane person and then got on a helicopter and flew away… and the whole nation just watched him go getting older makes my life better i like getting older though because for me the kind of guy i am getting older makes my life better you know like my sex life way better at  look ’cause this situation is ok at  this is not a fun kind of a yearold to be and some people their life is better when they’re younger you know young dudes young skinny dudes best life in the world is being a young skinny dude they don’t have to do anything they just show up with a big adam’s apple and a smelly tshirt hey i’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life so where do i everywhere ok cool but for guys like me this is not a fun youth it gets better i’d like to make one of those it gets better ads for just dumpy young guys we could use a little help a little encouragement just somebody on tv listen man i know it’s tough right now you’re vaguely heavy with no face you have zero value on the sexual marketplace you feel invisible to the girls in school because you are but it gets better because you’ll all grow up and you pretty much look just like this your whole life and they don’t their options start running out really fast and you’re gonna be there as long as you stay relatively employed and washed you’re gonna be amazing in your  you’re gonna be you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab before she hits the ground it’s gonna be so great it just takes time for her circumstances to match your looks but it’s gonna happen it’s gonna happen when real shit matters you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world it’s just time that’s all it takes there’s a formula to this it’s pussy plus time over income squared everybody has their time everybody has their time everybody has their time i mean not everybody there are people out there who there’s just nobody for them yep people like to say things like there’s someone for everyone nope not at all true and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody there are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips even nobody touches their genitals their entire life they just wash it and then they die that’s all that happens aww and if you’re feeling bad for them you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah i didn’t think so that’s the one way we’re all mean nobody does that nobody fucks down nobody people fuck up or across some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up some guy yeah no you should i’m totally up yeah dating takes courage it’s a weird selection process that we have dating really is it’s how we evolve is dating it’s how we choose each other and dating is a real drag for a lot of people but i always think it’s a nice thing you know when i see a date i’m always happy when i see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying you know you see a couple on a date it means there’s still courage out there that takes courage to go on a date for both sides two very different kinds of courage the male courage traditionally speaking is that he decided to ask he went up to a random woman who he has no idea if she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified everything in your body is telling you just go the fuck home and jerk off don’t do this but he walked up and said hi yes and she’s like  no no no a second give me a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know and then if it works and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes she’ll say yes and if she says yes that’s her courage and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything i can imagine a woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and illadvised and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it and i don’t know how they how do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men we’re the numberone threat to women globally and historically we’re the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to women we’re the worst thing that ever happens to them that’s true you know what our numberone threat is heart disease that’s the whole thing that’s it just our own heart going dude i can’t you can’t keep doing this i told you three strokes ago that this is not smart but women still yeah i’ll go out with you alone at night what are you nuts i’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders hi where are we going to your death statistically how do they still do it if you’re a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you’re like i hope this one’s nice i hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do first date i always i love when i see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together and she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out and he’s just a mess a guy on a first date just has no actual personality he’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each just anything no cohesive just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines just you know well… ha ha well yes i think so too ha ha rrgh… whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions hoping to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened there’s something that happens in a date that i never get to witness ’cause women do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly i’m gonna let him fuck me they just get to decide something he says and she’s like that was good he’s gonna fuck me later and he has no idea he’s still like trying all this shit he still has no idea he’s already in there tits guys are we love women a lot all men do and we just look at you that’s what i do i just look at women i just like they’re you know cakes in windows i just i was walking in new york once and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me and i was trying to walk slowly so i could hear what they were saying to each other you know ’cause they were cute so i wanted to hear them like that’s gonna help me in any way to hear their don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for like one second ok here here i go thank you it’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that if you’re a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth could you squeeze my tit for one second and  of us will go yes of course that doesn’t matter i could be doing open heart surgery yeah ok beep don’t worry he’s not your tits don’t worry about it i don’t know why we love tits so much some people say it’s because we breastfeed but so do women or you know baby women not grownup women don’t usually you don’t see like a yearold woman like a stately look you know like sigourney weaver like sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit thank you deborah i’ll see you tomorrow at  it’s not usually the thing is the elderly breastfeeding from the young except for at the end of the grapes of wrath which i don’t mean to ruin that book for you but you should have read it by now i don’t know if you read the grapes of wrath but that’s how it ends with an old dying man sucking milk out of a young girl’s tits and then the book is over and you’re like jesus what happened at the end there that’s crazy there’s no other book in that genre there’s no dense historic classic that ends with a weird porny paragraph at the very and then anna karenina shat on his chest holy moly with that the end my god that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book i’ve been reading this book for three months but we do we love tits and you always know a tit you always know a tit you know like you ever been in a crowded place like a subway or like you know a sports stadium and you’re smooshed in with other people and your elbow touches a tit behind you you’re like that’s a tit i just touched it i know that was a tit i know it because the sensitivity of the male elbow to tit flesh specifically is unbelievable just to tits ’cause you could drive a tack in there i’m not gonna feel it but a tit through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket and her jacket sweater shirt and bra somehow… it’s a tit i touched a tit i touched a tit i touched one tit one tit that’s rare to touch one tit it’s like a fourleaf clover usually you touch two the only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident or you didn’t have permission but otherwise… when tit access is granted it’s usually good for two tits at a time it’s once you’re on one you really have to screw up really badly and quickly to lose tit access between tits one and two you must have said something really dumb on the first tit that you didn’t get the second one yeah it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit why what i said i liked it that’s what i meant is that i like it i like your mom’s dirty whore tit and i like yours and if it’s up to the guy we’re gonna touch both tits no guy touches a tit and then goes you know what i’m good with the one that’s fine for me everything in moderation we’re gonna touch both even if something terrible happens in the middle of yeah there’s a bomb shit come on let’s get come on let’s get your tits out of here divorce i’ve seen a few tits i’ve seeni don’t know  maybe i don’t know i had my history in my life you know i’ve been divorced for five years and it’s been the best part of my life being divorced easily my favorite part of my life i love being divorced every year has been better than the last that is the only time i can say that about and by the way i’m not saying don’t get married if you meet somebody fall in love and get married and then get divorced because that’s the best part it’s the best part marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness which is divorce because you just let go and everything’s fine now divorce is forever it really actually is marriage is for how long you can hack it but divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak nobody ever says  my divorce is falling apart it’s over i can’t take it and again if you’re in a good marriage stay in it if you’re in the best marriage ever stay in it i’m just saying if you got out it would be better that’s just a fact i’m sorry i’m sorry but it’s true everything’s better my exwife and i this is the best part of our knowing each other we’re good coparents because we live apart and we’re friends our kids go to her half the week they come to me half the week and i’m a good father i’m an attentive focused and responsible father do you know why ‘cause i get to say goodbye to these kids every week are you shitting me it’s like every parent’s fantasy who can’t be a good father for half of every week no matter how bad it gets every wednesday i get to go goodbye girls daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now i’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here that’s why i’m such a good dad videoing your kids my daughter was having a dance thing at her school they had this big dance anyway we all went all the parents and everybody’s there and everybody’s got their phone every single parent it was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing and every parent is standing there like this every single person was blocking their vision of their actual child with their phone and the kids i went over by the stage and the kids there’s people holding ipads in front of their faces it looked like we’re all in the witness protection program like the kids can’t see their parents and everybody’s watching a shitty movie of something that’s happening ten feet like look at your fucking kid the resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look it’s totally hd why are you taping this you’re never gonna watch it in a million years you’re not gonna watch videos of your kids doing shit you missed the first time it happened you don’t watch it you just put it on facebook here you watch it i wanna take a nap now and then you get to read all the comments my god it’s so cute ngaah and guess what they’re not watching it either they’re not watching the video these kids are dancing for no one nobody watches the videos on your facebook they see the first frame of a kid and they go that’s very nice ok back to this nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on facebook i promise you i’ll prove it to you next time you tape your kid’s dance tape one second of it and then add  minutes of just your own asshole just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for  minutes tack it onto your kid dancing for a second put that on facebook everybody will write the same thing that’s adorable i think i see a future star life is a good deal don’t tape shit on your life is short life is very short i like life i like it i feel like even if it ends up being short i got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift when you think about what you get with a basic life not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life if you have a life that’s an ama here’s your boilerplate deal with life this is basic cable what you get when you get life you get to be on earth first of allmy god what a location this is earth and for trillions of miles in every direction it fucking sucks so bad it’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad you get to be on earth and look at shit as long as you’re not blind or whatever it is you get to be here you get to eat food you get to put bacon in your mouth i mean when you have bacon in your mouth it doesn’t matter who’s president or anything you just every time i’m eating bacon i think i could die right now and i mean it that’s how good life is you get to you get to fuck that’s free if you’re smart that comes with that’s part of the deal where else are you gonna get that deal you get to put your dick in there and go in and out pretty good and if you’re a woman you get to just lay back and just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly anytime you want anytime you want if you’re a gay man you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick just fill it all the way to the balls and it’s nice and warm and tight in there and he’s your buddy if you’re a lesbian you get to do all the stuff they’re doing and… it’s a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read to kill a mockingbird it’s a great life so you know i’m not worried about it ending behind the wheel it’s pretty good and i’ve wasted a lot of time just being angry at people i don’t know you know it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people depending on the situation like most people are ok as long as they’re ok but if you put people in certain contexts they just change like when i’m in my car i have a different set of values i am the worst person i can be when i’m behind the wheel which is when i’m at my most dangerous when you’re driving that’s when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons and yet it’s the worst people get and i am the worst one time i was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and he kind ofi don’t know sorta drifted into my lane for a second and this came out of my mouth i said worthless piece of shit i mean what an indictment what kind of a way is that to feel about another human being worthless piece of shit that’s somebody’s son and things i’ve said to other people i was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did i don’t remember even and i yelled out my window i said hey fuck you where outside of a car is that even nearly ok if you were in an elevator and you were like right next to a person’s body and whatever like he leaned into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you worthless piece of shit no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you there’s nothing you would not say to them i hope you die i said that to a person i hope you die why ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life you tested my reflexes and it worked out fine so now i hope your kids grow up motherless i mean what am i capable of i’d like to think that i’m a nice person but i don’t know man if murder was legal a lot of it is context there’s a lot of things i wonder if the world was different like if murder was legal i might have killed a few people i don’t know i’d love to think i would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder is the numberone thing preventing murder we’d like to think it’s ’cause like i would never do that no it’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering a lot if murder was legal or just a misdemeanor like you get a thing in the mail shit they had a camera there well if murder was legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderers would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder if murder was legal you wouldn’t like them i never killed anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep i mean not even a hooker live a life what’s wrong with that guy he’s like a mormon or some shit i hate those guys i think he’s nice shut up janet they would just if murder was legal there would be a lot of murder children would behave very differently because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids that’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal you know you’d go to a mall there’d be like eight different moms in the mall just i told you to stop it you didn’t listen to me justpbbt there’d be just you’d be stepping over dead kids there’d be like a new problem you have to clean up your kids when you kill them ’cause it’s gross it’s bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers every three feet of america put your murdered child in the red bag with a logo of a murdered kid on it next to the other logo that tells you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave them in the bag that is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts right in a row right in a row that is a compressed area of bad thought of course but maybe you know you have your bad thoughts hopefully you do good things everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts hopefully the good thoughts win for me i always have both i have like the thing i believe the good thing that’s the thing i believe and then there’s this thing and i don’t believe it but it is there it’s always this thing and then this thing it’s become a category in my brain that i call of course… but maybe… i’ll give you an example ok like of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected of course we have to segregate their food from nuts have their medication available at all times and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies of course but maybe… maybe if touching a nut kills you you’re supposed to die of course not of course not of course not jesus i have a nephew who has that i’d be devastated if something happened to him but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year we’re done with nut allergies forever no of course not of course if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt it’s a terrible tragedy of course of course… but maybe… maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot it’s not that weird maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at it’s a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened listen listen you all clapped for dead kids with the nuts for kids dying from nuts you applauded so you’re in this with me now do you understand you don’t get to cherrypick those kids did nothing to you of course of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened of course it is every time it’s happened black people in america jews in egypt every time a whole race of people has been enslaved it’s a terrible horrible thing of course… but maybe… maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves every single thing where you go how did they build those pyramids they just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished how did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just threw chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them there’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people you can do anything that’s where human greatness comes from is that we’re shitty people that we fuck others over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where they’re making these they jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you’re taking a shit thanks a lot folks you guys were great thank you very very much thank you'"

'cause it be mean to people who never find anybody there be million of people out there who we 've all unanimously decide they be light speed ugly and nobody kiss they on the lip even nobody touch their genital their entire life they just wash it and then they die that be all that happen aww and if you be feel bad for they you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah I do n't think so that be the one way we be all mean nobody do that nobody fuck down nobody people fuck up or across some woman fuck down because a guy talk they into that it be up some guy yeah no you should I be totally up yeah dating take courage it be a weird selection process that we have date really be it be how we evolve be date it be how we choose each other and date be a real drag for a lot of people but I always think it be a nice thing you know when I see a date I be always happy when I see a couple on a date 'cause it mean people be still try you know you see a couple on a date it mean there be still courage out there that take courage to go on a date for both side two very different kind of courage the male courage traditionally speak be that he decide to ask he go up to a random woman who he have no idea if she be gon na like he or not and he walk up to her terrify everything in your body be tell you just go the fuck home and jerk off do n't do this but he walk up and say hi yes and she be like   no no no a second give I a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know and then if it work and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes she 'll say yes and if she say yes that be her courage and the courage it take for a woman to say yes be beyond anything I can imagine a woman say yes to a date with a man be literally insane and illadvise and the whole species ' existence count on they do it and I do n't know how they how do woman still go out with guy when you consider the fact that there be no great threat to woman than man we be the numberone threat to woman globally and historically we be the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to woman we be the bad thing that ever happen to they that be true you know what our numberone threat be heart disease that be the whole thing that be it just our own heart go dude I ca n't you ca n't keep do this I tell you three stroke ago that this be not smart but woman still yeah I 'll go out with you alone at night what be you nuts I 'll get in your car with you with my little shoulder hi where be we go to your death statistically how do they still do it if you be a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you be like I hope this one 's nice I hope he do n't do what he be go to do first date I always I love when I see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it be the first date 'cause of the way they be walk together and she be look up at his face try to figure he out and he be just a mess a guy on a first date just have no actual personality he be just a mishmash of different kind of dude for a couple of second each just anything no cohesive just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazine just you know well … ha ha well yes I think so too ha ha rrgh … whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrust in infinite direction hope to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that be later down the line and something have happen there be something that happen in a date that I never get to witness 'cause woman do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly I be gon na let he fuck I they just get to decide something he say and she be like that be good he be gon na fuck I later and he have no idea he be still like try all this shit he still have no idea he be already in there tit guy be we love woman a lot all man do and we just look at you that be what I do I just look at woman I just like they be you know cake in window I just I be walk in new york once and there be these two very cute woman walk behind I and I be try to walk slowly so I could hear what they be say to each other you know 'cause they be cute so I want to hear they like that be gon na help I in any way to hear their do n't you wish the guy walk in front of we would squeeze our tit for like one second ok here here I go thank

matter I could be do open heart surgery yeah ok beep do n't worry he be not your tit do n't worry about it I do n't know why we love tit so much some people say it be because we breastfeed but so do

mockingbird it be a great life so you know I be not worried about it end behind the wheel it be pretty good and I 've waste a lot of time just be angry at people I do n't know you know it be amazing how nasty we can get as people depend on the situation like most people be ok as long as they be ok but if you put people in certain context they just change like when I be in my car I have a different set of value I be the bad person I can be when I be behind the wheel which be when I be at my most dangerous when you be drive that be when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life 'cause you be fuck drive a weapon amongst weapon and yet it be the bad people get and I be the bad one time I be drive and there be a guy ahead of I and he kind ofi do n't know sorta drift into my lane for a second and this come out of my mouth I say worthless piece of shit I mean what an indictment what kind of a way be that to feel about another human be worthless piece of shit that be somebody 's son and thing I 've say to other people I be once drive and some guy in a pickup truck do I do n't remember even and I yell out my window I say hey fuck you where outside of a car be that even nearly ok if you be in an elevator and you be like right next to a person 's body and whatever like he lean into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you worthless piece of shit no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of piece of glass and some road between you there be nothing you would not say to they I hope you die I say that to a person I hope you die why 'cause you make I go like this for half a second of my life you test my reflex and it work out fine so now I hope your kid grow up motherless I mean what be I capable of I 'd like to think that I be a nice person but I do n't know man if murder be legal a lot of it be context there be a lot of thing I wonder if the world be different like if murder be legal I might have kill a few people I do n't know I 'd love to think I would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder be the numberone thing prevent murder we 'd like to think it be 'cause like I would never do that no it be 'cause it really suck getting catch murder a lot if murder be legal or just a misdemeanor like you get a thing in the mail shit they have a camera there well if murder be legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderer would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you would n't trust somebody who do n't murder if murder be legal you would n't like they I never kill anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep I mean not even a hooker live a life what be wrong with that guy he be like a mormon or some shit I hate those guy I think he be nice shut up janet they would just if murder be legal there would be a lot of murder child would behave very differently because mostly parent would be murder their own kid that be mostly what would happen if murder be legal you know you 'd go to a mall there 'd be like eight different mom in the mall just I tell you to stop it you do n't listen to I justpbbt there 'd be just you 'd be step over dead kid there 'd be like a new problem you have to clean up your kid when you kill they 'cause it be gross it be bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bag that be in the dispenser every three foot of america put your murder child in the red bag with a logo of a murder kid on it next to the other logo that tell you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave they in the bag that be a whole bunch of horrible thought right in a row right in a row that be a compressed area of bad thought of course but maybe you know you have your bad thought hopefully you do good thing everybody have a competition in their brain of good thought and bad thought hopefully the good thought win for I I always have both I have like the thing I believe the good thing that be the thing I believe and then there be this thing and I do n't believe it but it be there it be always this thing and then this thing it be become a category in my brain that I call of course … but maybe … I 'll give you an example ok like of course child who have nut allergy need to be protect of course we have to segregate their food from nut have their medication available at all time and anybody who manufacture or serve food need to be aware of deadly nut allergy of course but maybe … maybe if touch a nut kill you you be suppose to die of course not of course not of course not jesus I have a nephew who have that I 'd be devastate if something happen to he but maybe … maybe if we all just do this for one year we be do with nut allergy forever no of course not of course if you be fight for your country and you get shoot or hurt it be a terrible tragedy of course of course … but maybe … maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shoot it be not that weird maybe if you get shoot by the dude you be just shoot at it be a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery be the bad thing that ever happen listen listen you all clap for dead kid with the nut for kid die from nut you applaud so you be in this with I now do you understand you do n't get to cherrypick those kid do nothing to you of course of course slavery be the bad thing that ever happen of course it be every time it be happen black people in america jew in egypt every time a whole race of people have be enslave it be a terrible horrible thing of course … but maybe … maybe every incredible human achievement in history be do with slave every single thing where you go how do they build those pyramid they just throw human death and suffer at they until they be finish how do we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just throw chinese people in cave and blow 'em up and do n't give a shit what happen to they there be no end to what you can do when you do n't give a fuck about particular people you can do anything that be where human greatness come from be that we be shitty people that we fuck other over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where they be make these they jump off the fucking roof 'cause it be a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candle and horse and be a little kind to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you be take a shit thank a lot folk you guy be great thank you very very much thank you\""

marketplace you feel invisible to the girl in school because you be but it get well because you will all grow up and you pretty much look just like this your whole life and they do not their option start run out really fast and you be gon na be there as long as you stay relatively employ and wash you be gon na be amazing in your   you be gon na be you be gon na be the branch that she can grab before she hit the ground it be gon na be so great it just take time for her circumstance to match your look but it be gon na happen it be gon na happen when real shit matter you be gon na be the sexy motherfucker in the world it be just time that be all it take there be a formula to this it be pussy plus time over income square everybody have their time everybody have their time everybody have their time I mean not everybody there be people out there who there be just nobody for they yep people like to say thing like there be someone for everyone nope not at all true and stop say it cause it be mean to people who never find anybody there be million of people out there who we ve all unanimously decide they be light speed ugly and nobody kiss they on the lip even nobody touch their genital their entire life they just wash it and then they die that be all that happen aww and if you be feel bad for they you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah I do not think so that be the one way we be all mean nobody do that nobody fuck down nobody people fuck up or across some woman fuck down because a guy talk they into that it be up some guy yeah no you should I be totally up yeah dating take courage it be a weird selection process that we have date really be it be how we evolve be date it be how we choose each other and date be a real drag for a lot of people but I always think it be a nice thing you know when I see a date I be always happy when I see a couple on a date cause it mean people be still try you know you see a couple on a date it mean there be still courage out there that take courage to go on a date for both side two very different kind of courage the male courage traditionally speak be that he decide to ask he go up to a random woman who he have no idea if she be gon na like he or not and he walk up to her terrify everything in your body be tell you just go the fuck home and jerk off do not do this but he walk up and say hi yes and she be like   no no no a second give I a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know and then if it work and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes she will say yes and if she say yes that be her courage and the courage it take for a woman to say yes be beyond anything I can imagine a woman say yes to a date with a man be literally insane and illadvise and the whole species  existence count on they do it and I do not know how they how do woman still go out with guy when you consider the fact that there be no great threat to woman than man we be the numberone threat to woman globally and historically we be the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to woman we be the bad thing that ever happen to they that be true you know what our numberone threat be heart disease that be the whole thing that be it just our own heart go dude I ca not you ca not keep do this I tell you three stroke ago that this be not smart but woman still yeah I will go out with you alone at night what be you nuts I will get in your car with you with my little shoulder hi where be we go to your death statistically how do they still do it if you be a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you be like I hope this one  nice I hope he do not do what he be go to do first date I always I love when I see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it be the first date cause of the way they be walk together and she be look up at his face try to figure he out and he be just a mess a guy on a first date just have no actual personality he be just a mishmash of different kind of dude for a couple of second each just anything no cohesive just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazine just you know well … ha ha well yes I think so too ha ha rrgh … whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrust in infinite direction hope to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that be later down the line and something have happen there be something that happen in a date that I never get to witness cause woman do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly I be gon na let he fuck I they just get to decide something he say and she be like that be good he be gon na fuck I later and he have no idea he be still like try all this shit he still have no idea he be already in there tit guy be we love woman a lot all man do and we just look at you that be what I do I just look at woman I just like they be you know cake in window I just I be walk in new york once and there be these two very cute woman walk behind I and I be try to walk slowly so I could hear what they be say to each other you know cause they be cute so I want to hear they like that be gon na help I in any way to hear their do not you wish the guy walk in front of we would squeeze our tit for like one second ok here here I go thank you it be

as people depend on the situation like most people be ok as long as they be ok but if you put people in certain context they just change like when I be in my car I have a different set of value I be the bad person I can be when I be behind the wheel which be when I be at my most dangerous when you be drive that be when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life cause you be fuck drive a weapon amongst weapon and yet it be the bad people get and I be the bad one time I be drive and there be a guy ahead of I and he kind ofi do not know sorta drift into my lane for a second and this come out of my mouth I say worthless piece of shit I mean what an indictment what kind of a way be that to feel about another human be worthless piece of shit that be somebody  son and thing I ve say to other people I be once drive and some guy in a pickup truck do I do not remember even and I yell out my window I say hey fuck you where outside of a car be that even nearly ok if you be in an elevator and you be like right next to a person  body and whatever like he lean into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you

a person I hope you die why cause you make I go like this for half a second of my life you test my reflex and it work out fine so now I hope your kid grow up motherless I mean what be I capable of I would like to think that I be a nice person but I do not know man if murder be legal a lot of it be context there be a lot of thing I wonder if the world be different like if murder be legal I might have kill a few people I do not know I would love to think I would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder be the numberone thing prevent murder we would like to think it be cause like I would never do that no it be cause it really suck getting catch murder a lot if murder be legal or just a misdemeanor like you get a thing in the mail shit they have a camera there well if murder be legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderer would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you would not trust somebody who do not murder if murder be legal you would not like they I never kill anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep I mean not even a hooker live a life what be wrong with that guy he be like a mormon or some shit I hate those guy I think he be nice shut up janet they would just if murder be legal there would be a lot of murder child would behave very differently because mostly parent would be murder their own kid that be mostly what would happen if murder be legal you know you would go to a mall there would be like eight different mom in the mall just I tell you to stop it you do not listen to I justpbbt there would be just you would be step over dead kid there would be like a new problem you have to clean up your kid when you kill they cause it be gross it be bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bag that be in the dispenser every three foot of america put your murder child in the red bag with a logo of a murder kid on it next to the other logo that tell you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave they in the bag that be a whole bunch of horrible thought right in a row right in a row that be a compressed area of bad thought of course but maybe you know you have your bad thought hopefully you do good thing everybody have a competition in their brain of good thought and bad thought hopefully the good thought win for I I always have both I have like the thing I believe the good thing that be the thing I believe and then there be this thing and I do not believe it but it be there it be always this thing and then this thing it be become a category in my brain that I call of course … but maybe … I will give you an example ok like of course child who have nut allergy need to be protect of course we have to segregate their food from nut have their medication available at all time and anybody who manufacture or serve food need to be aware of deadly nut allergy of course but maybe … maybe if touch a nut kill you you be suppose to die of course not of course not of course not jesus I have a nephew who have that I would be devastate if something happen to he but maybe … maybe if we all just do this for one year we be do with nut allergy forever no of course not of course if you be fight for your country and you get shoot or hurt it be a terrible tragedy of course of course … but maybe … maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shoot it be not that weird maybe if you get shoot by the dude you be just shoot at it be a tiny bit your fault of course of course slavery be the bad thing that ever happen listen listen you all clap for dead kid with the nut for kid die from nut you applaud so you be in this with I now do you understand you do not get to cherrypick those kid do nothing to you of course of course slavery be the bad thing that ever happen of course it be every time it be happen black people in america jew in egypt every time a whole race of people have be enslave it be a terrible horrible thing of course … but maybe … maybe every incredible human achievement in history be do with slave every single thing where you go how do they build those pyramid they just throw human death and suffer at they until they be finish how do we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly we just throw chinese people in cave and blow em up and do not give a shit what happen to they there be no end to what you can do when you do not give a fuck about particular people you can do anything that be where human greatness come from be that we be shitty people that we fuck other over even today how do we have this amazing microtechnology because the factory where they be make these they jump off the fucking roof cause it be a nightmare in there you really have a choice you can have candle and horse and be a little kind to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away just so you can leave a mean comment on youtube while you be take a shit thank a lot folk you guy be great thank you very very much thank you'"
