she die first for her sake because I do not want she to lose the dog I do not think she will be able to handle it if she die if the old lady die first I be not worried about the dog because the dog do not even know about the old lady this dog be aware of three inch around his head he be live in twosecond increment the second he be in and the one he just leave be all he know about but if he die this lady she be gon na be destroy because this dog be all she have and I know he be all she have because she have he there be no if she have one person in her life she would not keep this piece of shit little dog even if just some young woman in her building one morning be to say good morning gladys she would be like good and just flush he down the toilet just poom poom the dog just keep bump on the

marketplace you feel invisible to the girl in school because you be but it get well because you will all grow up and you pretty much look just like this your whole life and they do not their option start run out really fast and you be gon na be there as long as you stay relatively employ and wash you be gon na be amazing in your   you be gon na be you be gon na be the branch that she can grab before she hit the ground it be gon na be so great it just take time for her circumstance to match your look but it be gon na happen it be gon na happen when real shit matter you be gon na be the sexy motherfucker in the world it be just time that be all it take there be a formula to this it be pussy plus time over income square everybody have their time everybody have their time everybody have their time I mean not everybody there be people out there who there be just nobody for they yep people like to say thing like there be someone for everyone nope not at all true and stop say it cause it be mean to people who never find anybody there be million of people out there who we ve all unanimously decide they be light speed ugly and nobody kiss they on the lip even nobody touch their genital their entire life they just wash it and then they die that be all that happen aww and if you be feel bad for they you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart aww well go fuck one nah I do not think so that be the one way we be all mean nobody do that nobody fuck down nobody people fuck up or across some woman fuck down because a guy talk they into that it be up some guy yeah no you should I be totally up yeah dating take courage it be a weird selection process that we have date really be it be how we evolve be date it be how we choose each other and date be a real drag for a lot of people but I always think it be a nice thing you know when I see a date I be always happy when I see a couple on a date cause it mean people be still try you know you see a couple on a date it mean there be still courage out there that take courage to go on a date for both side two very different kind of courage the male courage traditionally speak be that he decide to ask he go up to a random woman who he have no idea if she be gon na like he or not and he walk up to her terrify everything in your body be tell you just go the fuck home and jerk off do not do this but he walk up and say hi yes and she be like   no no no a second give I a second and you try to get through this membrane of you know and then if it work and you say you wanna go out sometime sometimes she will say yes and if she say yes that be her courage and the courage it take for a woman to say yes be beyond anything I can imagine a woman say yes to a date with a man be literally insane and illadvise and the whole species  existence count on they do it and I do not know how they how do woman still go out with guy when you consider the fact that there be no great threat to woman than man we be the numberone threat to woman globally and historically we be the numberone cause of injury and mayhem to woman we be the bad thing that ever happen to they that be true you know what our numberone threat be heart disease that be the whole thing that be it just our own heart go dude I ca not you ca not keep do this I tell you three stroke ago that this be not smart but woman still yeah I will go out with you alone at night what be you nuts I will get in your car with you with my little shoulder hi where be we go to your death statistically how do they still do it if you be a guy try to imagine that you could only date a halfbear halflion and you be like I hope this one  nice I hope he do not do what he be go to do first date I always I love when I see a date you know when you see a date you can tell it be the first date cause of the way they be walk together and she be look up at his face try to figure he out and he be just a mess a guy on a first date just have no actual personality he be just a mishmash of different kind of dude for a couple of second each just anything no cohesive just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazine just you know well  ha ha well yes I think so too ha ha rrgh  whatever just like a blind dick in space just thrust in infinite direction hope to find pay dirt at someplace and then sometimes you see a date that be later down the line and something have happen there be something that happen in a date that I never get to witness cause woman do this they get to do it inside they get to just decide quietly I be gon na let he fuck I they just get to decide something he say and she be like that be good he be gon na fuck I later and he have no idea he be still like try all this shit he still have no idea he be already in there tit guy be we love woman a lot all man do and we just look at you that be what I do I just look at woman I just like they be you know cake in window I just I be walk in new york once and there be these two very cute woman walk behind I and I be try to walk slowly so I could hear what they be say to each other you know cause they be cute so I want to hear they like that be gon na help I in any way to hear their do not you wish the guy walk in front of we would squeeze our tit for like one second ok here here I go thank you it be really a flaw in man that we would all do that if you be a woman you could ask any guy on planet earth could you squeeze my tit for one second and   of we will go yes of course that do not matter I could be do open heart surgery yeah ok beep do not worry he be not your tit do not worry about it I do not know why we love tit so much some people say it be because we breastfeed but so do woman or you know baby

if you be a lesbian you get to do all the stuff they be do and  it be a great deal you get to eat you get to fuck you get to read to kill a mockingbird it be a great life so you know I be not worried about it end behind the wheel it be pretty good and I ve waste a lot of time just be angry at people I do not know you know it be amazing how nasty we can get as people depend on the situation like most people be ok as long as they be ok but if you put people in certain context they just change like when I be in my car I have a different set of value I be the bad person I can be when I be behind the wheel which be when I be at my most dangerous when you be drive that be when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life cause you be fuck drive a weapon amongst weapon and yet it be the bad people get and I be the bad one time I be drive and there be a guy ahead of I and he kind ofi do not know sorta drift into my lane for a second and this come out of my mouth I say worthless piece of shit I mean what an indictment what kind of a way be that to feel about another human be worthless piece of shit that be somebody  son and thing I ve say to other people I be once drive and some guy in a pickup truck do I do not remember even and I yell out my window I say hey fuck you where outside of a car be that even nearly ok if you be in an elevator and you be like right next to a person  body and whatever like he lean into you a little bit would you ever turn right to their face and go hey fuck you worthless piece of shit no literally zero people would ever do that but put a couple of piece of glass and some road between you there be nothing you would not say to they I hope you die I say that to a person I hope you die why cause you make I go like this for half a second of my life you test my reflex and it work out fine so now I hope your kid grow up motherless I mean what be I capable of I would like to think that I be a nice person but I do not know man if murder be legal a lot of it be context there be a lot of thing I wonder if the world be different like if murder be legal I might have kill a few people I do not know I would love to think I would never do that but we really need the law against murder for one simple reason the law against murder be the numberone thing prevent murder we would like to think it be cause like I would never do that no it be cause it really suck getting catch murder a lot if murder be legal or just a misdemeanor like you get a thing in the mail shit they have a camera there well if murder be legal there would be so much murder regular people would murder murderer would murder even more and then really nice sweet people would murder a few people but nobody would murder no people you would not trust somebody who do not murder if murder be legal you would not like they I never kill anybody ok nice meeting you yecch what a creep I mean not even a hooker live a life what be wrong with that guy he be like a mormon or some shit I hate those guy I think he be nice shut up janet they would just if murder be legal there would be a lot of murder child would behave very differently because mostly parent would be murder their own kid that be mostly what would happen if murder be legal you know you would go to a mall there would be like eight different mom in the mall just I tell you to stop it you do not listen to I justpbbt there would be just you would be step over dead kid there would be like a new problem you have to clean up your kid when you kill they cause it be gross it be bad for the environment if you murder your child in a public place please use one of the red bag that be in the dispenser every three foot of america put your murder child in the red bag with a logo of a murder kid on it next to the other logo that tell you not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag because they might suffocate in which case you could just leave they in the bag that be a whole bunch of horrible thought right in a row right in a row that be a compressed area of bad thought of course but maybe you know you have your bad thought hopefully you do good thing everybody have a competition in their brain of good thought and bad thought hopefully the good thought win for I I always have both I have like the thing I believe the good thing that be the thing I believe and then there be this thing and I do not believe it but it be there it be always this thing and then this thing it be become a category in my brain that I call of course  but maybe  I will give you an example ok like of course child who have nut allergy need to be protect of course we have to segregate their food from nut have their medication available at all time and anybody who manufacture or serve food

yeah yeah you know I be happy really to see black people come a lot of black people do not fuck with I like they use to but there be a few reason you do not see black people at my show one be because obviously black people have slow internet connection I mean that would be my guess I do not know what actually my own action draw a wedge between I and the community I hold so dear a couple of week ago I be suppose to be in flint michigan for a charity benefit that be suppose to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in flint I do not know if you know this but the water in flint be fuck poisonous it be actually make people sick hollywood people be like so what at least they have water but this water this water be fuck up so a lot of black celebrity fly into flint and they do a tremendous charity benefit and I be on the schedule to appear uh  so the reason a lot of people have not hear about this benefit it be the same day as the oscar right I know so I be on my way to the airport to go to flint and then chris rock call I and be like hey dave I get a ticket for you for the oscar can you make it and I be like sure n I g g a I be on my way to the airport right

some guy you can just tell the other one seem like a money guy maybe he be from texas or some shit but the gay one be definitely the leader because he do all the talking and then he hit I with so david um  do you have any movie idea that you would like to pursue the truth be I do not but if you know the game you be not suppose to tell motherfucker you do not have idea I be like yeah man I get plenty of idea and he call my bluff really like what huh oh um  um  and then I just start make up shit that I think maybe he would like to see I say I have a superhero idea he go really I go yeah he be a he be a gay superhero he be like really what be it call huh oh it be call it be call same hero new boot it be about a gay souschef in san francisco  that get bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he be take out the trash and be bless with power beyond his wild dream supersonic gay kind of power and he start save everybody in san francisco but at first he only save gay people later he save everybody and the whole city just fall in love with he the only problem be no one remember he when he save they well I do not understand why would not they remember he I say because dummy he be gay he keep change his outfit people come up  thank for save I sir what be your name anyway  he be like  same hero new boot  and that motherfucker fly away he be like I like it a lot the texan do not like

american way like superman but more than superman he beat up mexican for no reason the texan be like you get my attention I be like man this motherfucker be so strong he can fly and do all this great shit only problem with this guy be he ca not even activate his power unless he touch unless he touch a woman  vagina not a long touch just a couple of pat he say well what be the problem with that I say the problem sir be that our hero be not a handsome man and he be often short on cash so whenever trouble break out he have to run around the city and convince woman to let he pat their vagina  please miss that building  on fire can I pat your vagina quickly people be die  but he ca not tell they exactly why  eww get away you be gross   please miss people be die just a couple of pat   eww

do not realize it but the whole green room be look at we all the celebrity be disgust ohh that guy from texas be like here be my card call I on monday that work out the second time I meet oj simpson it be right after the trial of the century there I be now a young man of probably   oj simpson be the most famous or infamous face on planet earth I be in a restaurant in beverly hill with my agent I be not alone in the restaurant but I be alone I be the only black person in the restaurant and in the  that feel very uncomfortable now I tend to enjoy it at this age I be have dinner with my agent celebrate a deal that they tell I be lucrative but I later learn fuck sucked and suddenly a group of woman walk by every race be in that group black white asian latina white white  and white again they be all gorgeous I watch they walk by then I see a familiar face al cowling the man from the infamous bronco chase walk by and embrace one of the woman and they walk towards the door could not believe what I see and then close behind he be oj simpson newly release from jail the restaurant fall still I be shocked I do not mean to say it out loud but it just come out oj he stop turn around to

in my eye and I could see in his eye that he do not remember meet I the first time and then he walk away and I look back at my agent and all of they have nothing short of disgust on their face and the only one with the courage to voice their disgust be a woman name sharon who use to represent I how could you she say how could you shake hand with that murderer I say sharon with all due respect that murderer run for over   yard and he be acquit so you know fuck it the glove do not fit the glove do not fit get over yourself some people ca not do that some people just ca not get over themselves gay people have a hard time do that recently here we go here come the deep water no recently I ve notice that I notice it with that manny pacquiao controversy yeah it be now in the gay community  defense manny pacquiao say some outlandish shit about gay people very not nice thing that I wo not repeat but there be biblical verse and some analogy to animal it be not a good look nike take his shoe immediately which I think be a little harsh a little harsh you know what I mean just cause he be asian you know what I mean how the fuck be you gon na take the shoe off an asian dude to appease a gay dude you know what I mean no you do not know what I mean but asian people kind of know what I mean no no asian in the front no no this be what I mean look you be an asian dude I say this with no disrespect we be all american right and we can agree that america have a huge body count all over the world but nowhere more than asia literally if you look at history recently we have bomb the masculinity out of an entire continent we drop two atomic bomb on fuck japan and they ve be draw hello kitty and shit ever since there be a lot of ladyboy in the wake of our bomb and I know these thing because my wife be asian she be filipino all right okay so that explain it now you know why you see I at all those filipino event I be not there pick up pussy I be drop some off I take my wife

know that they get a whole generation of kid in the philippine grow up without their mother yes a lot of woman in the philippine go to the arabian peninsula they come to the united state they make all their money here they send all that money back home which be still one of the numberone staple in the philippine  economy money that the expat send back to the philippine the man on the other hand be leave rear child twiddle their thumb wait on their wife  check these man have be fuck emasculate and then suddenly a boxer rise from amongst they and reinstate their manhood with his motherfuck fist this be not the guy you be suppose to ask what do you think of homosexual he be not your champ shit that be why I do not have a sneaker deal cause if you say something that people do not like they will take your fuck shoe off if martin luther king have a sneaker deal we would still be on the back of the bus it be true the nike exec would come up hi martin uh  we need you to tone down the talk of civil right and black be human it be upset our southern distributor but I do not understand I think that be why I have a sneaker deal in the first place not quite really it be a walk shoe and we

twentyfour you do not know shit you do not know shit you get ta google shit that I live through see this be why I lock motherfucker  phone up seriously because the young kid you guy need to take a break from that we all need to break just from that technology just for a minute you know I be from a different time young man a dark time to you I be from a time that I do not even use to know who be on the phone until I answer the shit like when tragedy use to strike I remember I be   year old and the teacher wheel a television set into the classroom you remember these day and she turn it on to one of three channel and she say class the space shuttle be take off and we be all gon na watch it take off man that shit be go great for like three to five minute that be right you remember it fuck explode right on television everybody on board dead immediately presume dead it be so bad the teacher look at all the kid and be like  you can go home it be a goddamn national tragedy this be cold war america the russian be laugh at we my point be for a guy your age would not even know the pain because in your generation it be like the space shuttle blow up every fuck day how can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing I be get over one cop shooting and then another one happen and then another one happen and another one happen I be cry about paris and then brussel happen I ca not keep track of all this shit so you just give the fuck up that be the hallmark of your generation and that be fuck up because your generation live in the most difficult time in human history this be the age of spin the age where nobody know what the fuck they be even look at do you know that plan parenthood be for abortion it be for people that do not plan thing out at all that be right so a guy your age do not really know how he feel be you prochoice be you anticonsequence what do it all really mean it be easy not to care for you but for we we be train to care we be raise that way I use to watch a fuck cartoon when I be grow up call care bear it be about a fuck group of teddybear people they be like teddy bear but they be like people and they be all different color and they all fuck just walk around care they care about each other and everything else they all have different design on their stomach and the design tell you something about what they might be like inside very very love group of being and when shit get real bad as nice as those teddy bear be they do not get mean face they got determine hmm and the leader would say come on guy it be time for the care bear stare remember that shit and they little teddy bear would lock arm  and stare at the problem and I be not even bullshit actual love would shoot out of their chest  and would dispel anything that be fuck up and when we grow up we want to be like those bear and then we get our heart break because we find out that life be not gon na let we do that and that it be impossible to shoot love out of your chest however I have shoot love onto somebody  chest before I do it all the time it be the next good thing you kid do not know your generation be just determined to be angry mad everybody  mad back when we be grow up only black people be mad now everybody be just try to get in on the act I try to think to myself when do everyone get mad and then I realize this happen before we be bear this be a long way to go but  it probably start in the second world war think about it all these black man million of black man leave the united state for the first time go over to europe with america  armed force and fight the nazi and make more money fight nazi than they ever dream they would make in the united state and a lot of those man while they be in europe just to be real not to be crass a lot of they probably get their dick suck by white woman I be sorry lady and gentleman this be world war ii europe and these be desperate time and penis be be suck for shoelace and chocolate and very frivolous thing and it be very hard to come back to america and sit on the back of the bus after you ve be in the south of france get your dick suck for a crunch bar or some crazy shit like that that be a lifechanging experience and while that be happen in europe here in america for the first time woman enter the workforce en masse by the million all the man be go someone have to run the factory the lady do it that be right this be the first generation of american woman to have independent income en masse and when the man come back the woman be not the same american woman have grow they be utter phrase that no woman on earth have ever speak before thing like no and shut the fuck up and I do not feel like it and then behind the scene of that there be a littleknown government agency that start test mind control drug on the american public they fuck up they test it for   year they do not realize these drug be not mindcontrolle they be mindexpande it be lsd and mescaline and shit like that and for the first time there be a new school of thought that be chemically induce that make people question the very society they live in by   the president of the united state be only   year old can you imagine dmx be old than that and he be gon na usher in a new era of peace he be gon na avoid the cold war he be gon na end segregation and they blow his fuck brain out in front of everyone in

watch and it be live big thrill but with that many people watch there be a bit of stick everyone  different everyone be a blogger everyone go I be offend why he say an horrible thing he say load of horrible thing yeah but that be a thing that I care about that be the thing about offense it be about personal feeling I do not care about the backlash comedian in hot water you know my girlfriend jane she worry and she read thing what have you say do not worry they wo not come to the house fuck em so I wind she up I pretend I be gon na say much bad thing than I ever would I have to make up bad joke than I actually  just to scare my girlfriend when I do the golden globe we go out about a week before it be in la we fly out I be write joke as the ceremony approach they release more presenter I take my pick I get a good intro for they yeah mel gibson I will introduce he yes about three day before this last one just to wind jane up I say I get a good intro she go what I say bill cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch please welcome helen mirren I do not do it she say you wo not do that I say no next day I get she again I say be this too much I say not even bill cosby carry enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast please welcome melissa mccarthy I do not do it I would never  I would never  tell a joke like that it be horrible I be just do it to annoy jane I would never even  think  of that so do not  even on the day on the way to the red carpet in the limo I say I will start   with a funny oneliner an oldfashioned joke she go what I say what do the deaf dumb and blind orphan get for christmas jane go I do not know I say cancer I do not do it so  you be getting offend at a joke that do not exist so  I would never say that in public so  to anyone who matter anyway so do not  I do not have to worry about offend anyone it just happen the big controversy last time I do it be a caitlyn jenner joke outrage on twitter the next day I mean a couple of people go it be transphobic it be not transphobic in the slight it be a joke about a trans person but it have nothing to do with that aspect of her existence and that be the other thing about offense people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target they be not necessarily the same I will tell you the joke you make your mind up it be live so they go your host for the   annual golden globe award please welcome ricky gervais they be all clap the actor be smile at I nervously it be brilliant right so I just go relax I be gon na be nice tonight I ve change not as much as bruce jenner obviously and I go   now caitlyn jenner of course and what a year she be had become a role model for tran people everywhere bravely break down barrier and destroy stereotype she do not do a lot for woman driver  that be a clever joke I will tell you why right it be layer no listen right the subject of that joke be stereotype I be play with the notion of stereotype I start by say she be a real woman a liberal progressive attitude then if she be a real woman I hit they with the oldfashioned stereotype she must be a bad driver then right the target of the joke be a celebrity kill someone in their car let  not forget that shall we a celebrity kill someone in their car run home and pop on a dress that be  the target of the joke just so we be clear okay she be interview a week later at a   press conference for a show of hers now cancel and  one of the press say what do you think of the ricky gervais joke she go maybe I should host the golden globe and they tweet that and e I in because they want a celebrity feud it be clickbait I rise to the bait obviously  I just send back let her host just do not let she drive another website that be in the room entertainment weekly they tweet a different headline and they e I in their headline be caitlyn finally break silence over ricky gervais I just send back at last she always brake too late bring it on bring it on but I be a considered comedian I like my joke to be accurate and my target to be fair so I be engage these people say why be it transphobic they say it be about a trans person that be ridiculous that be like say a joke about bill cosby be automatically racist it depend on the joke but I be willing to learn I find out my crime be that I deadname she I would never hear that term before a day after the golden globe and that be say her old name and even acknowledge she use to be a man but she do I see he on the olympic game he be a decathlete   he be in everything all over the place shoot put and pole vault he win a medal he be famous he be on telly all the time you know a big  famous  man with a huge  I do not know I be guess probably he be big but I ve learn my lesson now I know it be wrong I would never deadname she now but year ago when she be a  man  year ago I be say and she go to the  doctor  and  knock on the door the doctor go come in this be year ago I would never deadname she now but this be like  a flashback before anyone  you know what  so  so like come in and he go hello bruce jenner because that  that be his name  then the doctor this be year ago  the doctor go all right bruce jenner how you do you fucker you big old lunk how you do come here you you fucker how you do brucie boy and bruce jenner that be   his name this be year ago right so  bruce jenner go yeah yeah not too bad doctor yeah what can I do for you bruce you fucker how you do boy and bruce jenner go that be his name bruce jenner go  look at that the doctor went come on bruce jenner you know the rule he use his whole name every time for some reason  come on bruce jenner you fucker you know the rule you ca not bring your big old pole vault pole in here mate bruce jenner go no that be not my pole that be my enormous penis well see as it be your penis you can bring it in here but you should have leave your shot put outside and bruce jenner go  that be his name for  fiftyeight year I think he go no they be not my shot put doctor they be my enormous testicle that be where I keep my testosterone and my spunk and shit right and the doctor go oh yeah that make perfect I be a medical man you be a big bloke you fucker how you do boy you be a big  you be big and you would have a big old  cock and  ball they be beautiful bit familiar innit no you must be very proud of they bruce bruce go this be go to surprise you doctor I wanna get rid of they and the doctor go what why oh they get in the way in the way of what fuck drive for one thing so I be engage these people and I be say but I have to say her old name that be the joke I say I ve change not as much as bruce jenner then I do the joke but no this be my second crime I say she have not change she be always identify   as a woman that mean she be a woman fine if that be the rule if you feel you be a woman you be I be not a bigot who think have all that do be science go too far in fact I do not think it be go far enough cause I ve always identify as a chimp right well I be a chimp if I say I be a chimp I be a chimp preop but  do not ever deadname I do not call I ricky gervais again from now on you call I bobo I be gon na have species realignment I be halfway there I be short with short leg and long arm I stoop my back be get hairy by the day I ve get fang like that I love nut I love nuts once I be at the zoo and people be look at I so I just start masturbate like  so  I be a chimp right I be a chimp if I say I be a chimp I ve get to live as a chimp for a year then have hormone get I all nice and hairy that would be lovely I be gon na stay a male chimp  so I can keep all that right male heterosexual chimp keep the same girlfriend jane would be happy she love I she love chimp so  you know I reckon that be get to be easy for a man to turn into a chimp we be so close than for a man to turn   into a woman in many way a bit of hair and a top lip like that as oppose to your cock and ball rip off  and a hole gouge out into I be not a doctor but that be  the gist of it I know which one I would rather have do I be not say chimp be well than woman no way right any lady here I ca not see you but to I every single one of you be equal  to a chimp so  so I would have all that do hair and that I would do all that all the  I will retain the ability to speak english like in emergency I be talk to jane she be go what be it what be it bobo you leave the fuck oven on there be a fire be you say that if caitlyn jenner be be chase by a wolf and there be a big fence but she have a long pole she would  revert she would be over that fuck  easy so I would have all that do top lip do all that right I will be legally a chimp I will be well  properly chimpedup I will be able to use chimp toilet I will be walk along hold jane  hand come on bobo right we do not hold hand now I do not know why she be all over I now I be a chimp but we will be all in love maybe match jumper come on bobo in love just two  like that then if a bigot in a van slow down and go that be fuck disgusting I will fle shit at he and run up a tree and that be why that joke be not transphobic so  cheer so humanity what be humanity what be we well we ve touch upon it there we be great ape not metaphorically we be literally great ape we be   genetically identical to a chimpanzee we be close to chimp than chimp be to gorilla we leave our common ancestor about six million year ago we have the same life cycle same as any other animal which be  our parent mate  we be bear  we grow  we mate  our parent die  our friend die  and then we die now  my sevenyearold niece do not like hear that but I say you ve get ta learn stop cry I say you be seven you know  today so  any more grizzling and this party be cancel so  let  take the first of those birth it be odd because a human be bear before the end of its natural gestation period I mean because of our evolution our brain be so big we have to get that huge head out early that be why the skull be in part and supple then we go on gestate outside the womb that be why we be so useless look at other mammal a giraffe be walk along it go I be proper pregnant right I be gon na have a baby giraffe right here yeah there it be see you later and the baby go mum it be get to be fuck ready we be  we be helpless right just think nine month we be grow in this perfect environment everything be  it be like be in a little kate bush video right then suddenly you be be squeeze out of an hole near an ass you be cover in shit there be scream you go I ca not breathe someone go yes you fuck can the first one second of life   on earth you do not know where you be you ca not choose where you be bear I be   bear in whitley estate in read right I would not have choose that I would have choose hampstead I do choose hampstead it just take    year to be able to afford it very different very different my upbringing to how I live now now I live a privileged life hampstead be ridiculous it be a rarefied place it be like the grandchild of poet and painter and I new money right but grow up it be tough I do not know about now but in my day my estate be rough and scary it feel like wildlife I be weak and vulnerable there be danger round every corner my school be on my street and I run there every day so I do not get mug or molest there be not many pedophile   in read the murderer have kill a lot but there be still a couple I move to hampstead oh my god there be no crime I see a knife once in hampstead it be a palette knife just a bloke oil painting in the middle of the street broad daylight noone

crop up even as I prepare for this tour people keep say he be out of touch he be so famous he be rich he be megarich I be right I could have this place burn down for a laugh no but they say thing like he be an observational comedian how can he say thing that relate to ordinary  scum and I say I say do not call they scum right but even the paper they try and  get around to it I do interview and they will always say do you always fly first class I go no often private right the number of time I ve answer this question they say do you know how much a pint of milk be to make you look out of touch I do not know but that be irrelevant next time a journalist ask I I will say I do not know but here be   a grand run and get I one be that enough that enough yeah another question I always get particularly with the posh sunday do a profile piece they be still try to alienate you make you look different they say thing like you do not have child I say no why do not you have child which be an odd question why do not you have child as oppose to ask people why do you have child let  ask the fat lady in the legging why she be have eight shall we nine that one just fall out that one do not even touch the side or  disturb her cigarette that one just  go and claim for that people say it be selfish to not have child how be it selfish to not bring   a life into the world that do not exist on any level there be not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetus go we want to be bear right but I ve think about it and there be three reason I do not have child three main reason and I will share they with you three reason one there be million the world  overpopulated noone  go rick be not have kid we be gon na run out fuck two kid be scrounger be not they I mean from day one it be all I I I be not it feed I clothe I pay for my chemotherapy no  no not my problem son not mine luck of the draw boy luck of the draw it cost the average household in the west   to bring up a child and they do not want to pay you back they be not grateful they do not go thank for have I it be I do not wanna be bear even if they get a top job which they wo not you will never see that money back they will just put you in a home okay and my kid he would be bear into ridiculous wealth would not he so  he would be a little cunt a little hampstead cunt  run around with all the other fuck little hampstead cunt be all hampstead and cunty I be a little hampstead cunt yes I know these be my cunty friend I know it be obvious I can tell from your little fuck cunty hat that you be little hampstead cunts you little posh hampstead  first he would know he be a little hampstead cunt I be a little  yes we know everyone know right he would know that right on the other hand he would know he would never live up to be as brilliant as his dad I would say I work my way up from nothing and you be just a useless hampstead cunt he would go yeah and that would probably prey on his little mind a bit eleven twelve he would be naughty run with the wrong crowd try and get out from under my shadow then he would turn to drug about   he would come home and overdose on my afghan rug twenty grand that be right and as he be there convulse and throw up his fuck lung right and with his little posh highpitche fuck death rattle  his little fuck die word he would go do you love I now daddy no no no I never do that be why you will never be bear you useless fuck junkie hampstead cunt and three  I would worry sick about he you know no I would   I ve only get a cat now and I worry sick about she I check the door three time when I go out so she do not escape I put food and water in every room in case the door shut and she be peckish a human baby oh my god the responsibility of a human life I would watch it sleep you

pad they so it do not run into it cave its head in and die then social service come round and say be this your child mr gervais yeah what happen here then I go it be a fuck idiot I do think of adopt for a while a little third world child because that would tick all three box one I would not be add to the population problem I would be alleviate an exist problem a young kid bear through no fault of his own into abject poverty he would have die I can literally save his life and give he a great upbringing right two he would be grateful would not he he would wanna pay I back woudnot he particularly if I let he know the   other kid in the village be not so lucky they do not  they do not make it out right I would tell he that early on so he really buck his idea up I would go tunde come here come

to I  I only find out recently I will share it with you now the distend testicle see you do not know about it but it happen in your fifty I be not check they or anything  I do not see em for   year as a young man they be pert and now they be like two plum in a sock I do not know when it happen but it be recently they just  and this be how I find out so as I ve be get old and they ve be secretly stretch away  as I ve get old I ve get rich so my bath have be get more luxurious last year I move into a new house in hampstead big bath big sunken bath southface window I be in there the first night

thing down with they and they would sink you know most people never see their  in the sea you be in trunk in the shower they dangle and bath be not usually that deep that be my first thought oh my god I never think testicle would float then my second thought kick in hold on this bath  two foot deep right I be sit on the bottom they be on top what be go on right and  I look and my testicle be now

should have give it a little whistle I be just think this be bizarre fuck hell right and  I think maybe it be a fluke so I hold they under the water for a minute I let they go and they bob up they be really  they be really buoyant right try it when you get home if you be in your   and a man obviously or caitlyn jenner but  but the world be get bad and I blame the beginning of its demise on social medium because twitter and facebook that be where this ridiculous notion breed and become stable that it be more important to be popular than right everything be like I agree with I it fall into two tribe I do not agree with they so I block they and now in this posttruth era people do not care about the argument they say who be say the argument no they be not on our side it be ludicrous okay and it also breed this ridiculous notion we ve always have my opinion be worth as much as yours now it be my opinion be worth as much as your fact which be nonsense I get tweet from people say I believe the earth be   year old I believe you be a fuck idiot you ca not have an opinion on the age of the earth you can have opinion but not your own fact but it be all about be popular right and even politician pick up those symptom politician tweet now they want to be popular we have a brexit referendum cause they pass the buck they do not want to make a mistake and there be a ridiculous thing of let  ask the average person what they think let  stop ask the average person what they  do you know how fuck stupid the average person be we still sell bottle of bleach with big label on that say do not drink right let  take those label off right for two year and then have a referendum but it be not just politician even real news the news on tv say thing like tweet we your news do not let they tweet you the news I see a tyrannosaurus rex you liar right there be a big news story last year about a train crash that happen a year before and there be an inquiry the result of the inquiry be publish and there be an expert on the news he say we ve look at everything and we ve decide that the speed of the train be a contribute factor so we be go to slow they down a bit statistically this should not happen again that would have be it but the guy go we ask the public what they think then there be three banal vox pop first one say I already pay £ a year so I be not happy the next one say it take I   minute each way it be not good enough the last one say I say it be well to arrive at work late than dead why be that on the news and when be that applicable in any situation all right te you be in early te oh te we ve be through this remember I say I would rather you arrive late than dead but  the big enemy be stupidity  right I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever get now admittedly when I first get on twitter I push my agenda I be an outspoken atheist not to change anyone  opinion I think it be important to tell the other side there be still   country where people be put to death for be an atheist I just want to say it be fine to be an atheist it be fine to believe in god and it be fine not to that be all I be say I realize I do not have to tweet about religion or atheism I could tweet a fact and that annoy just the right people I would tweet thing like happy birthday earth four point six billion year old today someone would always go we know what you be fuck do this be a tweet I get   after one of those and  it be all in capital which excite I  that be the sign of twitter madness mix with anger it be great right I look at his profile sure enough he be a gentleman from texas he be a fundamentalist creationist christian which be fine he love god he love god and  fetus mainly he love the fetus from conception to when it turn out gay and then he be  remember it be in capital he be shout at I good tweet ever your science my science right science by the way be spell scient already good be not it I mean  he be obviously hear the word he take a guess  never see it write down because it be not in the bible so he be  your scient wo not help you  well it will it be help he  beam this little message up to a satellite and down to I your scient wo not help you when satan  of course he believe in satan why not he believe that god make the universe in six day you be not gon na say to he do you believe in satan and have he say bit farfetched why do not god kill satan that be  what I would ask he if I be wrong and I meet god I would go oh you do exist he would go yeah I would go I ve get a few fuck question mate the first one would be why do you make chocolate kill dog mental right also if you hate homosexuality so much why do you put the male gspot up the arse what  what be wrong with you then I would say why do not you kill satan and he would go what I would go why do not you kill satan if he do all the bad stuff and you do   all the good stuff which you want  I mean you do want yes yeah you could kill he if you want you can do anything easy yeah why do not you kill he then because  shut up your scient wo not help you when satan be rape your british ass and he be get a point because if I die and I find myself in hell be rape by satan  science have pretty much let I down but it be this last line that he just throw away the line he sign off with make this the good tweet I ve ever receive your scient wo not help you when satan be rape your british ass I will be laugh so  he be there too he be  so he be a fundamentalist  christian who be live his life by the old and new testament he die he wake up in hell right which

joke it be about context   it be about content what do you mean by a rape joke she say even a joke with the word  rape  in it be unacceptable I say that be ridiculous it depend what the joke be I tweet that clip of I in the office go I think there be be a rape up there everyone get that because of the context and the target be a middleage man who be so narcissistic he will say anything to win a silly game you have to understand the joke and where it come from I say   some joke do not punch up or down they do not punch anywhere they can just be a pun a play   on word that do not really mean anything a joke go round when I be a kid even adult tell it I will tell you a woman go run into a police station she say help I ve be grape the policeman say do you mean rape she say no there be a bunch of they that be a rape joke right so  and I even say to she no I agree in most case yeah real rape joke   they be fuck horrible when the victim be the target disgusting I would never tell those but it depend on the joke not the word or the subject I calm it down and they agree some joke be bad than other she end it by say well okay I see your point but  still  I will laugh at a joke with the word  rape  in it when noone in the audience have be rape I should have leave it I just send back what a weird door policy you turn up to a comedy gig pay your money someone say can I just ask you a question yeah have you ever be rape I have yes you ca not come in what why a lady say she wo not laugh if you be in off you go that be what the world be like people take everything personally they think the world revolve around they particularly on twitter I be not tweet anyone I be just tweet I do not know who be follow I I ve get   million follower they can be follow I without I knowing choose to read my tweet and then take that personally that be like go into a town square see a big noticeboard say guitar lesson and you go but I do not fuck want guitar lesson what be this there be a number here right call that be you give guitar lesson I do not fuck want any fine it be not for you then just walk away do not worry about it I should say one thing in twitter  defense I use it as a marketing tool and for fun like everyone else but one great thing about twitter for I personally I be very into anti animal cruelty year ago it would take age to get   signature on a petition stand outside tesco  or something that be the magic number because then it gets hear in parliament I ve be part of many campaign through twitter when we ve get   signature in day and the law have be change thank you to those who ve retweete about animal cruelty it make a difference thank you but even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty you think no one be gon na argue with that yes they will they just wanna be hear I will tweet something about a bull be torture in a bullring for entertainment I say ban bullfighte someone always say what about the kid in syria what well I be not give you a choice you can do both I be not say throw that kid back in the hole there be a bull here and there be one thing that I do not want in my head but it exist so we have to deal with it now that I find out through twitter there be a thing call the yulin dog meat festival in china every year and it be horrendous and we send people with money to buy the dog to bring they back it be a drop in the ocean they eat thousand over this weekend I tweet the detail the petition people do not really read it it be a kneejerk people say racist I go what they go we eat pig and cow in the west yep we do I do not but yeah I use to you be right a pig or a cow be worth as much as a dog it be not about the specie it be what they do to these poor dog what they do be torture the dog first  cause they think it make the meat taste well they beat they they blowtorch they they even skin they alive and I see this picture  on twitter of the opening of this ceremony these two guy in this chinese square and they be skin this dog alive it be scream they be laugh it be the bad thing I ve ever see I think I ve get to tweet that I tweet the picture with a petition and I just say one beautiful creature and two ugly cunt skin it alive right and it take off load of retweet it make the press I get one tweet back from a woman that say be that language necessary I should have leave it right but I be  I be incense I say you be more offended by a word than by an animal be torture to death she say I just hate the cword I definitely should have leave it I send back people who hate the cword would hear it a lot less if they do not go round act like such cunt thank you you ve be fantastic good night cheer thank you so much thank you so much I hope you enjoy the show I hope noone be offend no I really do that be not the point I ve always want people to know they can laugh at bad thing without be bad people I think it be my upbringing I grow up  in poverty with nothing but the point be to pay your way then have a laugh that be the man the woman carry on work it be my old brother bob it be he who I first see make these dark joke right in the bad situation as thing be happen people be laugh I realize he be heal they that be what comedy be for what humor be for it get we over bad stuff right typical bob story he once spend an hour in the pound shop in hayle island just ask the cashier how much everything be just to see if he could break this poor man  will bob be the first person I see answer back to authority the first authority you come across be your parent and he would get in trouble he got send to bed but I think he would win the argument and he would tease my mum my mum be a typical workingclass woman as I say we live in a shitty area right and most of the house look like a bit of mud and a steal bike and fence post miss she mend the fence turf the garden herself paint the step she think if it look   respectable we would be respectable it be about reputation I guess bob would send her postcard that just read be that pedophile postman still read your mail and she would take it she would go in and she would be horrify she would call bob he see it this time you must stop do that even at her funeral  my mum die first and my dad carry on for a year or so just drink beer then he go at mum  funeral we have different duty I do catering and flower bob go to see the local vicar that be a mistake right we would never be to church he do not know we we do not know he so he say to bob tell I about your mum so I can say a few word bob see that as an opportunity right so bob with a straight face say well she be a keen racist the vicar go I ca not say that bob say okay put she like gardening he be try to get   the vicar to say something to make we laugh in church he do not warn we and he do get something by the vicar so we be call ricky robert bob ricky robert marsha and larry now larry be the old in his seventy bear in the war I always think he be the sensible one first bear weight of the world on his shoulder my mum say when he be a teenager he get a job and give she the money to help out he be a standup guy larry so bob  give the vicar the wrong name do not warn we we be all in church start of the funeral we be all there pack out the coffin come down guide by the vicar the vicar go to his pulpit all confident with his little note right and he go  eva leave behind four love child ricky robert marsha and barry and  we snort like that right bob be go  everyone realize we be all laugh we see larry go  all right and the church be like  every time we think of it we would see larry go  like that right then we would just start giggle just fit of fuck giggle right larry eventually start do this and the vicar  thinking what have I say right he would put in a few thing the vicar do not know that set we off again thing that be just lie or slightly wrong my niece and nephew start cry I would come prepare with a pack of tissue they would take one and hand it on before the funeral I would take the tissue out write on they fold they back and put they in and each tissue say snivel fuck bitch and they be sort of laugh so it be like a madhouse right everything the vicar say or do we all   start fuck laugh right and you could see the vicar be visibly shake a little bit he end the funeral and he make a beeline for I and bob he say sorry be that okay I and bob go   fuck brilliant   mate it be fuck brilliant that be what I mean we be all   gon na die so we should have a laugh if you can laugh in the face of adversity you be bulletproof I and my brother bob have one simple rule and that be if you think of something funny you ve get to say it win lose or draw it might go well  it might go badly but you ve get ta say it and bear that in mind as I leave you with this right  so  we be all in the car one day bob  driving pack in this car a little day trip to the beach we get stop for a security check and there be a british bobby there and he stop the car bob be at the window he say where be we off to bob go bognor he go   can you just pop the boot please so he look at that look in the boot like that back to bob  window get that mirror on a stick thing

fuck yourself click they do not care   I learn a long time ago I think whatever you be into you be into but I be not into that religious stuff where and this be why I actually walk away from my religion I have to be honest with myself one I do not like to go I do not like go to church every week you know I just do not part of it be I be lazy I do not like get up on sunday and the other part be I already hear all the story okay hear they three four time the dude have not come back yet you know we be just sort of mulch over the same shit here I get it   right    and the other aspect be you know I actually I have to be honest with myself I feel my religion make sense and everybody else  sound stupid   I do look I be not talk about the basis of every religion basis of every religion make sense you know the ten commandment do not kill anybody do not touch my wife that be my bike right that all make sense of which I ve break I think I ve break just about every commandment except for the fifth one that be it I have not kill anybody yet right but the murderous thought that I have sometimes I think I could do it like when someone get on a plane and they kick off their loafer and they be wear those goldtoe like dress sock and they cross their foot at the ankle and they just start rub their foot together like I see the whole thing see the whole thing wrap that sock shh  shh  shh  right see the whole thing so we will see still early on right but just the story of how we get here and where we be go and what happen after we die everybody else  religion sound stupid you know like I live out in los angele there be a bunch of scientologist out there and the first time I hear the story of scientology I be like that be the dumb shit I have ever hear in my life   yeah like your guy  name be ron ron and he be not alive thousand of year ago so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery this guy be alive like    year ago he have a driver  license social security number there be like footage of he stub his toe motherfucker right I know what happen he be work at denny  he get sick of it I will start a religion hey everybody there be this spaceship come back everybody be get sneaker this be tom cruise we be gon na try to make you clear right look I be paraphrase I be paraphrase to be fair to the scientologist I be paraphrase but that be essentially what they believe in and I say that be the dumb shit I ever hear while simultaneously still kind of believe that a woman who never got fuck have a baby that walk on water die and come back three day later so  yeah that make total sense to I so it just hit I one day I be like why do that make sense and that shit do not you know they get a spaceship in theirs you know we right we get the space shuttle you know there be sneaker there be a lot of shit I can relate to in this why do that sound so dumb to I you know what it be I think it be cause I hear their story when I be an adult I hear my story when I be four year old right when I hear my story there be still some fat fuck come down the chimney give I christmas toy if I lose a tooth there be a fairy there be the easter bunny why would not there be some bearded baby moonwalke across the lake throw out bottomless bucket of shrimp or whatever he do of course that make sense what happen be as I get old all of that stuff start to fall right ah son there be no fat fuck it be your mother and I your mom be the tooth fairy rabbit do not have egg her tit be fake the nba be fix banker be cunt most of your dream wo not come true right and I be just like wow this be how the world be and meanwhile this shit be just float this pound gorilla of this fuck story I just have to make a decision what be I gon na do what be I gon na do with this be I gon na cling to it be that person that be very offensive to I and other christian and  become that douche all right and be like the casual christian right with like one foot on base just yeah I kind of go a couple of time a year and like if my parent come to town I act like I go all the time and I do not go anymore or my last option which be basically just just let go of the shit you know just let go   just let go of it like that creepy moment in curl you know that moment where the shooter or whatever you call they be just slide with that rock right just let I do this right just slide and you think he be along for the ride the two of they they be a team and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just go fuck  that rock just keep go this dude just stop that be what I do with my religion I just let go of it I do not read a riot act to anybody I just let go of it and on the third day he rise again in fulfillment of the scripture  I just float away   so now it be like I be in this weird place where I be not in any religion right now unrestricted free agent you know   I would like to believe in something so I ve be go around ask people what their shit be and I have not be able to find anything try to be openminde I be do a gig in helsinki and over there they be like lutheran and what they believe they believe when you die you be dead and that be it dead like a pigeon just just layin  there over blow my mind I be like really you be just dead like my religion be you die and then you go up to get judge right god pop in the dvd of your life well I do not know about this right here mind explain yourself this might be the most arrogant thing I say all night but I actually resent the fact that I be gon na get judge someday like if that be true that somebody be gon na judge I that do not even make any sense it be like dude you make I so this be your fuckup all right let  not try to turn this around on I you know jesus christ you give I freedom of choice you make whore you have I suck at

some woman will fall in love well he be nice he wear a sweater he like to bake you know he let I finish my story which be all great quality okay but you got to know when you shack up with a guy like that you be roll the dice you be roll the dice that that fuck axe murderer be gon na pick the next house over cause god forbid he pick your goddamn house this be the dude who have your back who be gon na be scream louder and high than you when this guy come through the fuck door and you be gon na turn around all you be gon na see be his cowardly foot go out the kitchen window I do not know man that be risky you know in reality I be be too hard on that guy yeah I be I be cause I be just as scared as he be except I do not scream out like he do and that be simple the simple reason be this dude he be hug too much as a child have people go how be your day what be wrong and all of that shit you know that be why I come down here I come out here to tell you guy you got to stop hug your child you be ruin this country now you can hug your daughter you get to do that you get to do that hug those hooker shoe right out of they let they know that you be a good man and to find another man like you you got to do that but your son you can hug they a little bit but every three four you get to fuck knock em down right come on it do not hurt get up I do not come from a family I do not know about you guy I do not come from a touchyfeely  call I when you get there mwah mwah none of that shit first time my mom hug I I think be like once when I be little and when I move out that be it and we only hug cause we know we be suppose to so we just try to like it be like two parking meter come to life like we almost bump head it be horrific fuck horrific to this day sometimes I drive down the street and I think about that hug and it be just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head I will just be drive down the street just be like  aaaaah anybody else like that you ever have to shout stuff out of your head there be something about I like all my regret come up when I be in the shower I do not know what it be I think cause I be in the shower and I have time to think and I will just think of shit I do in third grade where I just make an ass of myself and I will just be in the shower just be like    and my wife  always just like be everything okay in there I will just be like yeah yeah just accidentally turn on the hot water turn it on too much every day so  yeah  I actually ask my mother one time when I finally get out in the world and I see how other family interact I finally ask she how come we never do the hugging thing how come we do not do that stuff she be like I want to hug you kid when you be little but I be afraid it be gon na make you gay and I be like you be afraid and she go well it be your father that be what it be protect he like I always do he be afraid he say you do not know how to raise boy and if you hug they that be what be gon na happen so in a marriage there be compromise yeah so she basically never hug we cause my dad say if she do it be gon na make we gay and I get to tell you that be a great thing that my dad do for I let I finish before you start blogge okay and I end up on a split screen on good morning atlanta comedy could it go too far last night at the tabernacle sit there next to some fuck cheetoeate blogger so yeah this be the deal I be gon na defend my dad here because this be basically what happen when you have a kid as far as I know I do not have any kid as far as I would think if you have a kid what do you want to do you want to improve on your childhood okay you want to keep the shit that your parent do that work and then you want to get rid of the stuff that do not work so that be my dad as fuck up as that be that be his improvement on his childhood that he never talk about the way a veteran do not talk about go to war so I figure if that be his improvement on his childhood his childhood just must have be something like do not change his shitty diaper let he figure it out for himself get out in the rain you shitty baby hey let I handle this lady why be you still stand here you shit toddler so he take it from that  and knock it down to do not hug he it be gon na make he gay right and then maybe someday I ever have a kid I will whittle it down to like he be not take drama class all right he be not take drama class cause I say so lady let I handle this I wo not fix everything and that be not a homophobic thing either that I would not send my hypothetical son to drama class okay it be not I would send  I would let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class okay my son ca not fuck do any of that shit unless I be send he to one of those fame high school where everybody be do it one of those creative school you go to the cafeteria everybody be like   cottage cheese what be it make of   then he can do all he want then he can do all the fuck he want but there be no way I be let he do that at a public school with those goddamn animal he be gon na get the shit kick out of he he be gon na come home with his underwear up his ass and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like there be some sort of tomfoolery go on around here I do not want to do that I want to find the fuck eightyearold what be he this tall I want to find the kid that do it to my kid tip he upside down into some sand or a puddle anywhere where oxygen be go to be an issue right and just leave he there you wait for that one leg to start shake so you know he be down to his last breath and then you turn he upsideright and you grab he by his throat you say something horrific you ever do that again I be gon na beat your mother to death with the family dog all right   over so yeah a lot in my life have change since I last come through here to atlanta I get marry that be the big thing yes I do very happy about that I be very happy because it be start to get weird it be like   year old my girlfriend yeah we be gon na go out and get some pop go to party it be just weird  cause I hang out with people my age and they all got marry they all have kid I just could not contribute when people

the outskirt you be fine you be fine you do not live in a desert you slam your face in a birdbath you be cool drink that water for a good   day la there be nowhere to go that be why I love the helicopter dude the helicopter be the ultimate fuck this I be out vehicle all you got ta do be assess the situation zombie come up the street fuck this this look safe you just land it you could sit there hover just sit there in a hover watch everybody getting kill sit up there eat cheese and cracker with the red stick yeah so I tell my wife I want to fly a helicopter she be just like yeah no which I know that come from a place of love but it still kind of annoy I just that she say that shit then I be just gon na be like oh all right think I be gon na get to do that but you say no so  there go that hey what other dream be not I gon na get to achieve like do you already know or be you wait for I to ask yeah I be still gon na do it I be just not gon na tell she I be just gon na go out and do it pass the goddamn class and when I get my license I be not go to tell she I be just gon na go out and buy a white silk scarf and hang it by a nail in the living room she be just gon na be like what be that what be that for what do that mean yeah someday you will see someday you will see when the shit hit the fan and you be freak the fuck out and I be take branch off some unforeseen helicopter what be that shut the fuck up and get in now you guy think I be bullshitting I be not I be serious I be   in on this and ever since I get into it I be see helicopter everywhere I never realize how many helicopter there be drive down the street like henry hill look up at they  do key bump and shit they be after I swear to god I be see story about they it be just like that old advertising anecdote I never realize how many mattress commercial there be out there until I need a mattress and then all of a sudden they be all over the place and then I buy a mattress and then it all go away it be the same shit I see this story down in orange county right down in orange county california this guy give helicopter tour for   year   year without incident hand the business off to his son the american dream I build it up for   year here you go son make the family and the family name proud all right dad I love you all right this poor kid five day in he be suppose to give a tour to a couple only the dude show up the kid think it be weird but he be like I need the money I get ta give he a tour right so he take this guy up ten minute into the tour the dude fuck jump out yeah five day in five day in from the balloon and the cake we love you son keep the family tree go the traditional line five fuck day later this kid he probably barely have the speech down just sit there fly the helicopter all right if you look out the left side of the aircraft that be orange county there be over   mile of beach there put your seatbelt back on   mile of beach be establish as a county in   sir please do not open the door sir what be you do sir no no do not do not stop no no what the fuck what the fuck oh my god oh my god oh my god what the fuck what the fuck fuck air traffic control I do not know who be on this frequency but you really need somebody just jump out of the fuck helicopter five day in so I read far into the story turn out the guy who jump out he be   year old terminally ill he be in pain every day they could not figure out what be wrong with he and he have have enough at that point that guy immediately become a hero in my world know what I love about he not only do he make the decision he do not go out like some pussy right handful of pill watch a romantic comedy wrap in an afghan that nana make fuck that guy go out like a man take I up in a chopper I be look at the land I love and then I be jump out like a superhero I love it yeah   this guy should have be wear a fuck cape I ca not imagine how elated he must have be on that helicopter ride up after finally just take back control of his life like fuck you disease I decide rip tube out get a burger shotgun a beer take I up in the chopper he probably have his fuck foot on the dashboard he be not even listen to this guy give the tour right over   mile of beach put your seatbelt back on establish as a county in   sir please do not try to open the door no no do not do not do not    incredible but here be the thing I leave out one small thing there be one small thing the guy fuck live yeah yeah they be out over the ocean   foot up you would think that would be enough so I be think he must have go in like greg lougani like no splash just  but witness say it look like a dummy be fall out of the air so that sound like a hell of an impact I think he accidentally do the most epic foot belly flop in the history of jump out of a helicopter but that do not change what he be try to do where his heart be I still love this guy I just feel bad for he on the way down he be get to be think three more second of pain two more second wham   oh my god this be bad this be way bad it have a happy ending though he later die at the hospital that be right so here be to he god bless he I

I do not care who the fuck the tough person be in this house I could defend my house with a bb gun I do not give a fuck how tough you be I do not care if I start shoot at you with a bb gun at the very least you have to go back outside and regroup that be a fact that be a fact if I catch you in your elbow that might be the end of your night look I be come back I be come back I ve be try to get along with my wife well I be try to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship I be not turn out the pilot light though all right I be keep some fight in I I be not gon na be that henpecke guy just

lot over television I ve kind of come her way she be come my way she watch a little bit of sport I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy which I do not care the nerd  gon na fuck the cheerleader I will watch it right I do not mind they it be an uplifting story I just do not like the love scene in romantic comedy they creep I out they be just so fuck nice it be like missionarystyle there be candle that stupid saxophone music   it always go down like the saxophone imply the penetration right  cause they ca not show it they get to make she this onedimensional this little angel they ignore the other   of her sexuality no hairpulle no assslappe none of that shit none of that taboo stuff of a woman  sexuality that be never bring up that whole hold I down but let I up but hold I down choke I but let I breathe but kind of scare the shit out of I a little bit I want to feel your power but I want to be safe but let I know if you really want to that whole fifty shade of rape whatever the hell that be yeah I do not even pretend to understand it I remember the first time a woman want to get I to choke she a little bit I do not even know what she be do I be just so psyched to be getting lay I be like  and she just keep take my hand and she keep put it right here I do not know what she be do I think she be test my core strength or some shit and finally I be just like what be you do she say like I do not know I just kinda like ya know it be like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it why do not you want to do it it will be fun why do not I want to do it I do not think I want a passedout naked woman with my fingerprint all around her neck have the cop show up yeah she be in here officer damnd thing it be her idea I swear to god it be her idea yeah they always make it nice in those movie the racy thing they will do be every once in a while they will kiss up against a wall I guess woman like wall I do not know that a lot of upagainstthewall kissing oh my god it be the wall oh my god it be support I maybe he will support I it be a metaphor I love it yeah I see one the other night they be do that and then out of nowhere they start have sex up against the wall I be like finally something a little bit more interesting right but they be do it stand up face each other missionarystyle arguably one of the most difficult position there be and they be do it with little to no difficulty all she do be lift her leg up like that and that be it he be off to the race I ruin the movie for my wife I be like that be fuck bullshit bullshit what do the guy have like a ushaped dick how be he do anything be he stick it in her navel do he grease up her thigh to hell with her need like if all she be gon na do be this she be get to bring it up like an offsides call if

lead to another  mean you all start fuck each other and she go we do we start  just shut up and she go what do you care for I say you be the mother of my child I do not wanna picture you be fuck by a  ″ nba player while you be lick out madonna  muscular vagina and denni rodman be in the corner stroke his tattooed cock go    and she go oh you be be silly what do you care for you ve partie way more than I have in my life and I go that be not true I ve gotten waste way more than you have but I have in no way partie way more than you have often I get waste just by myself I would not call it a party for most of my career I be a struggle comedian right and this be how struggle comedian party right it be   be monday right we be in a onebedroom apartment seven of we be stand around a coffee table try to stretch out two gram of coke one of we be at the end of the table give conspiracy theory  and the rest of we be talk about where woman might be one of we have come up with a plan the plan go like this well  nurse will be finish their shift soon maybe if we just stand out the front of the er they will appreciate seven funny guy   I do not  you know I ve never partie like a model I have partie twice in my life twice like really partie I ve have good night out but I ve really partie twice if you really party and most people never experience this it be an amazing thing it happen in vegas it can only happen in vegas and it be get ta involve celebrity right I be not famous but the people around I be super famous and I be at this party in the night club and they take I in and then there be the night club but then there be the real night club out the back which be like the size of this stage it be only a little room and you go back there and you can just  they encourage you to take drug in the open and you be just do it off a key   and they be go no dude use the table do not use your  and I go oh oh oh sorry um  and it be confuse at first and then their security will drag woman off that other night club into your room just bring em in like huh and you can do this you can go  uh  like that and they will drag these woman away it be the good thing you will ever do with your life when you party that hard as a man there be a lot of remorse cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money you wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover and you go to your friend you go oh my god we partie so hard last night I spend   when a hot girl party that hard she wake up in the morning and go oh my god we partie so hard last night I make   and that be a vastly different emotion that  I do not think woman will never  yeah okay this be the thing in america at the moment they be try to raise the minimum wage to I do not know   an hour or something like that and whenever they bring up this argument they always go and still to this day woman only earn   of what man earn in the workplace and of course that be disgusting how dare woman earn so much like  a lot of thing that I say tonight will be joke that I do not actually mean but this be something I be really passionate about woman do not deserve to earn as much money as man in the workplace I be sorry I    I be not be a misogynistic bastard right I be not say that woman do not work as hard I be sure they do I be not say they do not do as good a job what I be say be they do not deserve to earn as much money as man right man need that extra   to buy meal and drink and jim jefferie ticket and all that shit   now  I be sure there be woman in this room that be say oh I pay for my drink I buy my own ticket and do not think we do not appreciate the ugli cause we do right we do but there be little thing in society that you ca not change man have extra expense that you will never understand there be holiday that be just for woman like valentine  day be just for woman they say it be for romantic they say it be for couple or something like that it be just for woman there be no man who get excite by valentine  day there be no man that when he see the valentine  day decoration go up in the shopping mall he go oh valentine  day be come valentine  day be a mathematical equation that every man have in his head and it go like this how much money do I have to spend today so that you wo not act like a cunt it do not stop there mother  day mother  day rock around in my house when my son be six month old my girlfriend  first mother  day and she go oh I wonder what I will get for mother  day and I go probably fuck nothing he be get no money he be six month old what do you think he be gon na buy you within an hour her friend be over at the house just by coincidence tell I what a bad person I be and how important mother  day be to a new mum you know and so I go and buy she a cappuccino machine cause I assume that be what hank would have want she to have  and I write a card I be not a bastard I write a card I be righthande so I get my left hand every new dad know this you get the crayon and you go   happy mother  day love hank and I go han  and then I do the k backtofront because he be a fuck moron see now I know there be people in the room they be think well father have father  day father  day be bullshit it be fuck shit father  day father  day come around and my girlfriend go what do you want for father  day and I go I do not want anything do not even worry about it I do not want anything and she go come on you got ta have something I say honestly I do not want anything and she go come on and I go it be my fuck money just do not touch it just leave my money alone how hard be this how about for   hour you do not touch my fuck money that would be a gift that be why every single father have that one father  day gift that they cherish and it be shit it be like a fuck ceramic mug that the kid make in school where the handle be too big and it say I heart dad and they keep that for   fuck year this mug and do you wanna know why they like it every now and again they look at it and go  that cost I nothing that mug   see  would not it be nice to have one day that be for man and for father and all that type of stuff but do not cost anything that everyone could participate in right I ve get it right april  anal sex day   it be good be not it everyone  girlfriend or wife have to take it in the ass on april   it be nice a month before you would be walk around the shopping center go oh the decoration be up   and it be good cause if your bird do not take it in the ass you could do the same thing that woman do on valentine  day when they do not get a gift you could go like oh I mate jason his wife take it in the ass twice yeah obviously they be more connected than we be they ve uh  I be think I do not do much merchandise after my show and stuff but I be think of bring out some april   tshirt not even put jim jefferie on they or anything just tshirt that say april    cause it be good right you be in a bar you be a guy you see a guy at the other end of the bar with an april   and you go  fuck friend for life right but even well you see a girl with an april   tshirt the weird thing be I be biggingup anal sex here and I do not even really like fuck girl in the ass that much I be not even a huge fan I much prefer the cunt I think it be a much more  I think that a cunt be a much more purposebuilt thing to fuck but you know anal sex  oh you know  I do it I get involve cause I feel like I have to you know I  but I ve never be a big fan of the ass fuck I uh  when I watch it on porn it seem very invite the girl  take it so fluently in her ass and she seem to be have fun and uh  but the thing be you ca not smell porn you do not smell porn you just  you just watch it they never  and it be different porn it be different they clean the girl

quick and they do other thing the porn girl I do not know how much they get pay I be sure it be more than what the man get pay it be the opposite bit of society um  but they do a thing call atm I do

you fuck one person have you oh how exciting and  and then what they do be they do not have a kid right away because they be still not ready we have to see how our career be go and shit and what they do be they get a dog and then they act like the fuck dog  their baby they refer to it as their fuck baby they send you a christmas card of they hold the dog  and it say from our family to your and

then they bring the kid back and the dog run up like what be happen a new person and they be like fuck off we do not love you anymore we be go and they think they ve learn something from the dog and they have not learn anything what happen if your girlfriend be away on work and the dog die you go off you buy another dog that look similar to the original dog  try to pass it off as the same dog what happen if your girlfriend be away on work and the baby die very hard  to get a baby that look exactly the same in the short period of time that you have easy if you be black or asian   boston no

that you can buy black and asian people I be yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from norway with a child go  yolanda quick get han bring he over come on   I be gon na talk about something now that sort of split the crowd a little bit uh  gun control now  no wait before you  do not get excited because the other people have gun the antigun people be like yeah do it jim no let  just    now before I start say this I wanna say this right I believe in your right as american to have gun I be not try to stop you from have gun all I be say be this be my personal belief on the opinion my opinion on the  oh it do not matter I do not like gun right I be gon na say some thing that be just fact right in australia we have gun right right up until   in   australia have the big massacre on earth it still have not be beat and  now after that they ban the gun now in the   year before port arthur there be   massacre since the gun ban in   there have not be a single massacre since I do not know how or why this happen uh  maybe it be a coincidence right now please understand that I understand that australia and america be two vastly different culture with different people right I get it in australia we have the big massacre on earth and the australian government go that be it no more gun and we all go yeah all right then that seem fair enough really now in america you have the sandy hook massacre where little tiny child die and your government go maybe  we will get rid of the big gun and   of you go fuck you do not take my gun   so here be where it get confuse right now as I say I be all for your second amendment right I think you should be able to have gun it be in your constitution what I be not for be bullshit argument and lie there be one argument and one argument alone for have a gun and this be the argument  fuck off I like gun it be not the good argument but it be all you ve get and there be nothing wrong with it there be nothing wrong with say I like something do not take it away from I but do not give I this other bullshit the main one be   I need it for protection I need to protect I I need to protect my family really be that why they be call assault rifle be it I ve never hear of these fuck protection rifle you speak of protection what the fuck be you talk about you have a gun in your house you be   more likely to use that gun on yourself than to shoot someone else and people think well that would never happen to I you do not know that because you know what ♪ from time to time we all get sad ♪   ♪ one day you be happy then you be sad ♪   ♪ and then uhoh ♪ protection I have a breakin in manchester england where I be tie up I have my head cut they threaten to rape my girlfriend they come through the window with a machete and a hammer and american always go   well imagine if you have a gun and I be like all right I be naked at the time I be not wear my holster I be not stare at the window wait for cunts with machete to come through what world do you live in where you be constantly fuck ready you have gun cause you like gun that be why you go to gun convention that be why you read gun magazine none of you give a shit about home security none of you go to home security convention none of you read padlock monthly none of you have a facebook picture of you behind a secure door go fuck yeah like you be go to be ready if someone come into your house you have it at all fuck time by the way most people who be break into your house just want your fuck tv you think that people be come to murder your family how many fuck enemy do you have jeez you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone be come to murder you see if you have it readily available it become unsafe you have it in your bedside table one of your kid pick it up think it be a toy shoot another one of your kid happen every fuck day but people go that would never happen in my house cause I be a responsible gun owner I keep my gun lock in a safe then they be no fuck protection someone come into the house you be like wait there fuckface oh you ve come to the wrong house here buddy boy I tell you what I be gon na fuck you up okay be it   to the left or   to the right your mother  birthday why the fuck would I know your fuck mother  birthday maybe if you do not leave the window open    because it be too hot in here  we would not be getting fuck murder right I find the nra to be hard work the fact that they always think the answer be more gun after sandy hook happen the nra say and I quote none of this would have happen if the teacher have gun I  I think they be forget what school be like do anyone remember that casual teacher that use to  whenever she come into school that relief teacher come you and your friend would see she and go   oh we be gon na make her cry and then she would stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hand would be shake and you would go you be never getting marry be you miss never gon na happen for you then she would get back to her   volkswagen beetle and she would be cry over the steering wheel just why do not they like I let  give that cunt a gun and see how thing work out   and then they go oh well answer to that we will just add more gun they go we will put an armed security guard at every school across america yeah that will work out the average security guard in america earn   an hour not a lot of wiggle room to be a fuck hero someone come onto the school and    and you ve get kevin now I be sure kevin  shithot at call of duty but it might not fuck cut it lady and gentleman now I understand that when I be do this joke in this room   of you agree with I   of you do not agree with I and I do respect the people who do not agree with I do not think I do not out of the   that do not agree with I   of those people be smart enough to realize this be a comedy show and it be not to be take seriously and they be laugh along cause it be just funny joke right and then the next   have sort of phase out a little bit they be look around go wonder how they get that chandelier up there and then  there be the last   and they be fuck furious right now in this room and the people watch at home    of you be fuck seethe just  and for a couple of reason first reason I be make good point   second reason second reason second reason and this be the big one I be foreign  and that be piss the fuck out of you right now and your brain be on a loop and you ca not fuck turn it off and it be just go around in a circle and you be just go if you do not like it go home if you do not like it go home and my answer to that be no I come here legally I pay my taxis I will say whatever the fuck I want your first amendment mean that I can say the second amendment suck dick and  unless you be an american indian you be a fuck immigrant as well so fuck off people get so precious about it I understand that to american your constitution be very important I respect it but please understand that every country have one as well it be no more special than any other constitution we have one in australia I do not know what it say I ve never see it if there be a problem we will check it but everything be go fine and do not get I wrong I get that the constitution be important to you I have had  fuck I get it right I ve have people come up to I in my face and scream at I in car park as I be leave the theater go   you can not change the second amendment and I be like yes you can it be call an  amendment if you ca not change something that be call an amendment see many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution and if you do not know what a thesaurus be get a dictionary and work your way forward do not think your constitution be set in stone you ve change thing before you use to have prohibition in there right and then people be like hey who like getting fuck up yeah I like getting fuck up too let  get that one out let  get that one out you use to have this other thing in america call uh  slavery and then lincoln come along and go that be it no more slave and   of you go fuck you do not take my slave and the same bullshit argument come out that you have with gun why should I have my slave take off I I be a responsible slave owner I be train in how to use my slave safely just because that guy mistreat his slave do not mean that my right should be take away from I I  I use my slave to protect my family I keep my slave lock in a safe that be the thing why should I have my gun take off I I ve do nothing wrong look I agree with you if you be a responsible gun owner and you do not fuck around with they then you should be allow your gun you really should but that be not how society work we have to play to the   that be such fuckwit they ruin it for the rest of we we have to walk as slow as our slow person to keep society fuck move right I take drug like a fuck champion right   we should all be allow to take fuck drug but we ca not can we because sarah take drug and she stab her fuck kid oh oh thanks sarah you fuck it up for everyone right everyone should be allow to drive their car as fast as they can do it right but we ca not because jonathan get drunk and run over a family thank jonathan now I have to drive at   you fuck idiot see that be the thing why should I have my gun take off I I be responsible just because that guy be crazy who be to say you be not crazy that be the thing about crazy people they do not know they be crazy that be what make they crazy the only thing you know for sure on this earth be I think therefore I be you know that you exist anything past that be open to interpretation right you know you exist and that be it right now I think I be in boston talk to   people that be what I think I be do but there be a good to fair chance that I be in a mental home standing in front of a white wall go   I hate gun I hate gun I hate gun   see one of the well argument be well if you take the gun away then only the criminal will have gun not true when they ban the gun in australia it work when they ban they in britain it work okay the bushmaster gun that the kid be gon na use in sandy hook cost like   american and you can buy it in walmart it will be deliver to your house that be it man   buck right that same gun in australia on the black market cost   now if you have   you do not need to be a criminal you ve get   you be a great little saver keep go so that cover the criminal but that do not cover the people who wanna murder your family that be come after you and your family it kind of do the people who do the massacre it cover they cause they go  the kid at colorado who think he be the joker let  say that he have some social issue the kid at sandy hook be asperger  as fuck right I do not know if you know a lot about the black market but you ca not just rock up at the dock go   gun who want to sell I a gun now I be gon na wrap this up we wo not talk about it anymore now  see the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arm I really agree with  that the real reason it be write be so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government in case the government become a bunch of cunt you could all get your gun and fight back and that be why it be write     yeah and that make a hell of a lot of sense when it be just musket but you do know the government have drone right you get that you be bring gun to a drone fight if we go back to musket I be all for it keep the second amendment if we all have musket  musket be awesome every cunt should be carry a musket with he at all time you know what be good about the musket it give you a lot of time to calm down someone call your wife fat and you be like fuck you buddy ah you be not a bad guy you be all right now  after the show we be gon na go out have a big party around boston see how it go I be not allow to go to strip club anymore my girlfriend have say that be a no  cause I do not behave myself in there so I be not allow to go to they anymore  cause strip club be not what woman think they be   it use to be like  okay so when a man go to a strip club it be all about girl be as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible that be what man want to see woman when they go to their magic mike club or whatever the fuck they be  woman wanna see a guy hey lady he be a fireman and he come out with his hose and like that  and whenever a stripper take their clothe off they ve still get the fireman  hat on or a tool belt on or policeman  gun on a holster right because even when a man  naked a woman want to know that he have a job when man watch stripper we want they to have a job and that job be strip we want to just look at that girl dance and have a hand full of money and just go  you ca not take care of your kid it be  and when man get private dance in these strip club I do not know  I do not know if woman actually know what go on in those room but basically it be dry humping there be no dancing the girl get in front she get where your cock be push it to one side and then she rub on it  and then she stand over and put her cunt right in your face and you go  that be what a private dance be right I do not know if there be private dancing in female strip club   I ca not imagine that there would be I do not imagine a woman get out of a back room and go up to her friend and go  she go how be it and she go well  he just sit I down and then he grab my genital  and then he drag his scrotum over my forehead I get to go to the atm so legit got cancel   yeah I know I know it who would ve think it would ve struggle on that great fxx channel that everyone know about the first season be on netflix this special be be record for netflix so you can go watch it there if you be watch the special it be  I be very proud of it we have two great season of really good television and if people do not  now  the whole tv show be base around one standup routine that I use to do about have a friend with muscular dystrophy that I take to a brothel which be a true story and so when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who  in the end we use dj quall and dj quall be the skinny white guy out of the movie road trip he be the skinny white guy out of the movie hustle   flow and he be the white guy out of the movie hustle   flow now  the great thing about dj be  he already look disabled he have that latter stage of aid thing go on it be great for cast anyway but  I do not want dj to begin with I want a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic and the actor  union of america say you can not do that because basically the problem be people with muscular dystrophy I think be only allow to work for two hour a day before they get too tired and I say all right what other disability and disease be allow to work long and they send I a list and on this list I say can you get rid of all the contagious one and what have we got leave so I see every disabled actor in hollywood and I will be honest with you not that many of they I do not know why maybe they be just lazy they do not wanna work maybe they give up on their dream rather quickly and none of they be very good either everyone we see none of they be very good cause act be all about what you do with your hand none of they know what to do with their hand and  they all come in until this one guy come in I have see a lot of people that day this guy be the most disabled person I would ever see in my life he be like  think of the most disabled person you ve see then double it  really super disabled he be shape like a pretzel he be be carry in by this big russian nurse carry he in he make that great disabled sound of    that one I just love he anyway  so he come in for the audition  and I be sit there and we be do the line together and at first I do not know if he be mentally all there either so I be be a little bit patronize I be go thank you so much for come in and then we do the dialog together and I do not have to worry about a thing this kid be funny he be smart his timing be impeccable I think he be just great and I help he out of the room and I come back to the director and I say that be our guy that be who we get ta pick and he agree but we have to see everyone else who be still in the waiting room so the next bloke wheel himself in now obviously he be just a paraplegic if he be wheel himself in which mean the waist down and that do not really suit I because  paraplegic can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance but I think  if he be a good enough actor maybe he can quadup for the role so he come in  he come in I shake his hand and his leg slightly come out at the same time and I go whoa what be go on there kicky and he go  oh you get I I be not disabled and I say you be fuck what now and he go I be not disable I just really want the role so I rent a wheelchair and I say just shut up so let I  this be how your day have mappedout thus far you wake up this morning you drive to the wheelchair rental place you rent a wheelchair you carry it out I assume you put it in the trunk of your car you drive here you get the wheelchair out you carry it up three flight of stair you go to the waiting room you put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse then you sit in it and practice your line and he go  yeah and I say you be a fuck asshole mate get the fuck out of here and I kick he out and later on that day I be sit there with all the headshot of all the different actor I be gon na call to tell they they ve get part and I be hold this disabled guy  headshot and I just think I be gon na call this guy up I be gon na change his life this be an awesome moment right and I be look at it and he look super handsome in his headshot he look really like  and I think this have get ta be the great photographer with the fast shutter in camera history the shutter on his camera have get ta be like    like    and then I read the guy  biography  and then it dawn on I this guy be not disabled either I hate the other fucker for rent a wheelchair this cunt rent a nurse do you wanna know the level of fuck psychosis you have to go through to rent a fuck nurse I be all for a method actor get into character three hour before but once you finish the audition stand up and go tada and we would have go that be very good but I will tell you what you do not do do not make I carry you to your car I carry he down three flight of stair go you do very good he be like thank you jim    I be uh  I go to a therapist  cause I get depressed so I get a therapist every now and again I literally have one of those moment with my therapist where she be say word like I be gon na say a word and you say the first thing that come in your mind like just out of the movie right and she go red and I go blue and then she go cook and I go food and all that type of stuff we go like this forever and then she go  for

human when a girl be on her knee and you  it be so  and as an atheist I believe in darwin and all the thing that he write but he never have a bit where he explain that there be never a bit in his book where he go when a caveman love a cavewoman he will ejaculate on her face so that fly wo not come near there be never that  never that moment but by golly if it be not fun I find it  to  look to all

out there you will die on august    that be pretty good all right hello hello chicago nice to see you again thank you that be very nice thank you look now you be a wonderful crowd but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show okay because  no no no thank you some crowd  some crowd they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of place to go so  I do not judge those crowd by the way okay we ve all go too big too fast and then run out of room we ve all make a happy birthday sign  wait you get that poster board up and you be like I do not need to trace it I know how big letter should be to begin with a bigass  h  follow by a bigass  a  and  oh no oh god okay all right real skinny  p  with a high hump and then we will put the second  p  below the hump of that first  p  sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation and now I have no room for the  y  so I will do a kind of curledup noodle  y  block letter and cursive look good together and then you go to write birthday and you totally forget the lesson you just learn with happy you be like yeah but the past be the past bigass  b  surely more letter will fit in the same space you be very friendly here in chicago I mean we be all violent here but you be very friendly no really and I do not like confrontation cause I ve never be in a fight before though maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walk out on stage I do not give off that vibe some people give off a vibe of  right away they be like do not fuck with I my vibe be more like hey you could pour soup in my lap and I will probably apologize to you when I walk for real my foot go out like this I be so open and vulnerable I look like a doll that you point out molestation on show we on this white comedian where the man touch you it be be a while since I ve be home to chicago I got marry since then thank you I marry my wife I love say my wife it sound so adult that be my wife it be great you sound like a person I say it even before we be married we be just date and we be once get on an airplane and anna  ticket do not say anything and my ticket say priority access it do not matter why but we be get on and I say uh can my wife board with I and they be like yes of course right this way and I be like oh that be so much well than all those time I be like  can my girlfriend come and yeah I should not have say it that way but still my wife just have some kickass to it you know get away from my wife no one talk to my wife marriage be gon na be very magical I do not kill my wife that be like ooh who be that fella I bet he do kill his wife be marry be so nice I never know relationship be suppose to make you feel well about yourself that be not really a joke that be just a little sweet thing I like to say  cause I would be in relationship where I got cheat on like long one I do not know if you ve ever be in a long relationship where you got cheat on but it change your whole worldview  cause when I be a kid I use to watch america  most want you know how kid do and I would always think to myself how could another person kill someone how could a human being kill another human being and then I got cheat on and I be like oh okay I be not gon na do it but I totally get it and I do not mean in that way of like no one else can have you I do not care about that it be just creepy to have an ex out there after thing have end badly they have a lot of information anyone who be see my dick and meet my parent need to die I ca not have they roam around I talk to a lot of people before I get engage you know and I hear this expression about whether or not you should get marry this be an old expression people say this they say why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free you ever hear that before it be a banana insult expression  to an entire gender but also it make no sense why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free you be not allow to milk a cow that you do not own that be not even a situation be that a problem at one point like in the dairy community be that happen a hundred year ago in some village some dutch prick be sneak in at night be like ahhaha I take your milk and the farmer be like well then this be your cow now and he be like no no proof of purchase and he run off into the night that sound dutch right you know what that  you know what that expression mean it mean why would you marry a woman if she be already have sex with you which have nothing to do with what relationship be even like anymore now it be like why buy the cow uh maybe because every day the cow ask you when you be gon na buy it and   you live in a really small apartment with the cow so you ca not avoid that question at all and also the cow be way well at argue than you be and the cow grow up in a family that know how to argue why buy the cow uh maybe because every time another cow gets buy you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale and your cow look over at you the entire time like  and do not enjoy the sale at all  even though she be the one that want to go to the sale and she be especially mad because that farmer and cow meet like eight month after you guy meet why buy the cow well let  be real here you be very lucky to have the cow that you do have roping in cow and get milk out of they be never anything you be know for john by the most liberal of estimate there have be about eight cow total several unmilked and  a lot of people think that you like bull and if you just buy  they assume it when you search your name the third thing to come up be like john mulaney bull and if you just buy the cow nobody would say that anymore they will still say it  cause there be those guy who they buy a cow and then on the side total matador but  but for real chicago why buy the cow let  be real why buy the cow because you love she you really do and yeah yeah  sure she be a bossy little jew but   she take care of you and you do not wanna be some old man stumble around like hey you see any loose milk my wife be jewish she be a new york jew I do it now I be raise catholic I do not know if you can tell that from the everything about I my wife be jewish I grow up catholic so we got marry by a friend be marry by a friend be a beautiful ceremony that alienate both family  religion while confuse the elderly people at the wedding what be the name of the bishop that be actually standup comedian dan levy he be the host of mtv  your face or mine I see a lot of catholic wedding though because I be an altar boy  and a hush fall over the room be not it weird how that become a scandalous thing that be just some boring shit I have to do on weekend but now it be like say I be a french maid for a period of time I be treat well in my day I work for a variety of sir no be an altar boy be just a boring gig you know you would serve mass and then you would serve wedding sometimes my brother be once an altar boy at a wedding and he be stand there with another altar boy in this big pack church in chicago where we grow up and the bride be come down the aisle and the organ be play and all the pew be fill and the bride get all the way to the altar and the groom lift the veil off of the bride and right at that moment the other altar boy say aw she be ugly and then they look and they be right next to the video camera and I know that be awful but would not you give a million dollar to see that wedding video it be the good moment of this stupid woman  life and she be walk down the aisle and the organ be like  and she get all the way to the altar to her betrothed and he unveil she to the world and to the eye of god and right at that second for no reason at all some cheetofingere ratmustache yearold prick decide to go aw she be ugly hopefully the videographer know some sound edit so he could fix it to be like aw she be beautiful she be enchant I grow up catholic I do not go to church anymore but I go on christmas eve with my parent cause you know how you lie to your parent so  we go into the church and I be like I get this under control and then I got school because they introduce a bunch of new shit no I be go through mass and I be bat like   and then in the middle of mass the priest say peace be with you and everyone say and with your spirit and I be the one pre asshole go and also with you what huh what huh what when when for those of you that be not catholic I do not mean to exclude you even though we love to exclude you but  there be a part in church where the priest say peace be with you and for many many year we all say    and also with you   very good but they change it to and with your spirit because that be what need revamp in the catholic church that be the squeaky wheel that need the grease in rome they be like let  see what problem can we solve problem one no I be actually glad they change that though I never like and also with you I always find that clunky and also with you that be not how you talk   have a nice day   and also you have one it be just a little bit wrong be not it it be just a little off like when someone be like how be you and you be like nothing much and it sort of make sense never begin a sentence with and also you just immediately sound catch offguard it sound like if at the first church ever like they be not expect it like the priest be like hey this be the first time we ve ever have church I just wanna say  peace be with you and they be like  what oh uh yeah and also you should have some hey that be good let  keep that for   year and then change it to trick john my wife and I do not have any child we have a dog we have a little puppy name petunia she be a tiny little french bulldog puppy I like have a puppy that be a bulldog cause it be like have a

like let  pretend it will be fun yes  my title of alpha which I once have how can I reclaim it because that be a thing that exist at one time she say you need to show dominance over your puppy these be thing people say to I I say how do I do that she say well let I ask you this who eat dinner first you or petunia I be like petunia eat dinner first she eat dinner at   pm cause she be a foot long

petunia and tremble my land stretch across this entire one bedroom and I eat dinner whenever I choose as long as it work for the schedule of a dog she say now you do not actually have to eat dinner

front of she we go mmm dinner mmm good dinner like we be space alien in a play about human being that they write but they do not work that hard on mmm we be eat dinner meanwhile petunia  just stare at

we would have little conference before we walk into a house she would go let  talk let  talk before we go in we be like two foot from the door so there be no toilet and I know that be on your list but I think I can get he to budge let  go so we would have a real estate agent and then like the house would have a real estate agent who be just some guy sit in a big chair and these two always hate each other they would be like hi tony hi kim it be like jesus christ what be you two in the eagle together what be the animosity about our real estate agent want we to have a baby more than anyone else in

game and catfishe pedophile these be my child and that be my wife I do not mean to make it sound like we do not want child we do not but I do not mean to make it sound like that see I just do not think baby like I very much sometimes baby will point at I and I do not care for that shit at all like I will be on an elevator and a baby will be there in its big like stroller activity tray just like work on one cheerio with bobby fischerlike intensity and it will look up at I and go  I like to lean in and go stop snitchin  motherfucker and then walk off  cause you be never too young to learn our national nosnitche policy my friend have baby and I do not do so well with they I have a runin with a twoyearold girl I know there be well way to start that story but  my friend jeremy have this twoyearold girl and I really like she she be a sweet kid I really like his daughter a lot but I be over at his family  house for the fourth of july and he have his daughter on his knee and it be a very lovely day his whole extended family be there and he be bounce his twoyearold up and down and he point at I and he say to his twoyearold do you know who that be that be your uncle john and I be like oh my god that be so sweet I be her uncle john and then the baby point at I and say uncle john have a penis I thank you for laugh because no one do that day fall deadly silent be what they all do hey do you know what you be suppose to say when a baby point at you and knowingly say he have a penis no I be ask cause I do not know what to say in that situation here be what I go with that day I say oh come on I do not know I think that would be good but then it just make it bad cause it sound like the baby and I have an arrangement not to talk about it and she have violate my trust like the baby have be like do you have a penis and I be like yes I do but you be a baby so discretion be key and then the next day she go he have a penis and I go oh come on someone ca not keep a secret luckily jeremy  wife save the day the baby  mom save the day she come in and she pick up the baby and she be like it be okay she be just go through that phase where she say penis and vagina a lot be not we all and by the way it would ve be a totally different situation if the baby have say vagina like if a grown woman have walk in the room and the baby have be like she have a vagina the woman could be like yes I do and it be magnificent and we would all be like hooray you be brave no one want to applaud the penis of a yearold weirdo it be fun to be marry I ve never be supervise before I be supervised she study what I do like an anthropologist she will be like sometimes he will watch a movie on tv even though he already own that movie on dvd point this out to he confuse and upset he I have no supervision when I be a kid we be free to do what we want but also with that no one care about kid I grow up before child be special I do very early  right before child become special like I remember when milk carton kid become a thing when they be like hey we should start look for some of these guy I do not think they be just blow off steam no one care about my opinion when I be a little kid no one care what I think sometimes people would say what do you think you be do but that just mean stop they do not actually wanna know my thought process they do not want I to be like well I be gon na put this bottle rocket into this carton of egg so that when I light off the bottle rocket the egg would explode everywhere oh well that be very interesting and what bring you to this experiment oh well thank you for ask well  you know how I be fill with rage I be so horny and angry all the time  and I have no outlet for it so  egg your opinion do not matter in elementary school either it matter in college college be just your opinion just you raise your hand and be like I think emily dickinson be a lesbian and they be like partial credit and that be a whole thing but in elementary school it do not matter what you think it just matter what you know you have to have answer to question and if you say I do not know you get an x on your test and you get it wrong and that be not fair cause your brain have never be small also that be not how life work I be in my   now if you come to I now and you be like hey john name three thing that the stamp act of   accomplish I would go I do not know get out of my apartment you know but when you be a little kid you ca not say I do not know you should be able to that should be an acceptable answer on a test you should be able to write in I do not know I know you tell I but I have have a very long day I be very small and I have no money so you can imagine the kind of stress that I be under or if it be one of those true or false question you should be able to add a third option which be who be to say kid be much more supervised now but also they have a lot of right like that be the big civil right increase I ve see in my lifetime the right of child have go through the roof I have no right when I be a little kid I remember one time I walk into a supermarket by myself and I walk in through the double door and the woman behind the register just look at I and she go no and I go all right and I turn around and leave that be how broken I be and there be not special thing for kid the way there be now like we would just go see movie any movie like back to the future that be a movie everyone could see kid could kinda see it great movie right I rewatche it recently it be a very weird movie marty mcfly be a yearold high school student whose good friend be a disgrace nuclear physicist and I shit you not they never explain how they become friend they never explain it not even in a lazy way like hey remember when we meet in the science building they do not even do that and we be all fine with it we be just like what who be his good friend a disgrace nuclear physicist all right proceed what a strange movie to sell to be a family movie two guy have to go in and do that they have to be like okay  we get an idea  for the next big familyactioncomedy all right it be about a guy name marty and he be very lazy he be always sleep late okay be he cool like ferris bueller no but he do have this good friend who be you know a disgrace  nuclear physicist I be confused here this good friend this be another student no no no no this guy be either like   or   even we do not know how old this guy be suppose to be but one day the boy and the scientist they go back in time and they build a time machine whoa okay I think I see where you be go here they build a time machine and they go back in time and they stop the kennedy assassination ah oh wow that be a really good idea I mean we do not even think of that all right well what do they do with the time machine well now I be embarrassed to say ah well all right all right all right we think  we think it would be funny you know if the boy if he go back in time and you know he try to fuck his mom I do not know we think that would be fun for people but no good point no he do not get to he do not get to  cause this family friend name biff he come in and he try to rape the mom in front of the son the dad be get ta beat the rapist off of she and also we be gon na imply that a white man write  johnny b goode  so we be gon na take that away from em well this be the good movie idea I have ever hear in my life we be gon na make three of they now you say they go to the past how about we call it back to the past no no no back to the future right but they go to the past yeah kid have it very good now my friend be a teacher she tell I that uh  the parent will take the kid  side over the teacher now that be insane that never happen my parent trust every grownup  more than they trust I I do not mean coach and teacher any human adult  word  be well than mine any hobo or drifter could have take I by the ear up to my front door and be like excuse I your kid bite my dick and my mom would be like john edmund mulaney do you bite this nice man  dick and I would be the only one who be like hey do not anyone wanna know why  his dick be near my biter  in the first place be not anyone curious  as to how I have access do not get I wrong my parent love we they just do not like we we be not friend people be now like my mom be my good friend I be like oh be she a super bad mom my parent do not trust we and they should not have trust we we be little goblin we be terrible I remember one time we be go to this resort for a vacation when we be little kid three week before we go to the resort my dad sit we down and he say all right we be go to a resort and I ve just be inform that the man who own the resort only have one arm and we be like oh yes yay yes now I be tell you three week in advance so that you will not freak out when you see that he only have one arm oh we be gon na freak out so bad yes john you have a question how do he lose his arm that be exactly what you wo not ask and then I do ask I go into the kitchen one day and I be like so how would you lose your arm and he be like well I be bear with only one arm and I be like nah no my parent love we it be just like they be the cop you know and we be criminal so we do not get along we only get along in that way that like cop will sometimes be chummy with criminal like when my dad and I would talk it be like that scene in the movie heat when robert de niro and al pacino sit down in that diner we kind of have that rapport of like hmm we be not so different you and I you have your law practice and I I have all these fuck marker I guess we both have responsibility when you look at it that way my dad would respect it if I could get away with break a rule we have a rule in our house you be not allow to watch tv on a school night so every school night I would   be watch tv and I would hear my dad come I would immediately turn the tv off and grab any book magazine periodical anything and I would open it and pretend to be do homework my dad would walk in the room and he would go what be you do be you watch tv and I would go no man I be not watch tv and the tv would not even be dark yet it would still have like a neon green halo around it it would be sizzle like a glass of pepsi and I would look my dad in the eye and go no I be just read this yellow page my dad love we he just do not care about our general happiness or selfesteem I remember one time we be really little kid I have two sister and a brother and all four of we be in our family car ride for three hour go to wisconsin my dad be drive go down the highway in our white van with wood around the side  cause you remember when you want your car to be make of wood you remember that era where we be like how much wood can we get on this car  without it catch on fire but then the big announcement we here at plymouthchrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car for all those time you ve look at your minivan and think  huh it need a belt so we be go on the highway we ve be on the road for three hour and in the distance we see a mcdonald  we see the golden arch and we get so excited we start chant mcdonald  mcdonald  mcdonald  mcdonald  and my dad pull into the drivethru and we start cheer and then he order one black coffee for himself and keep drive and you know as mad as that make I as a little kid in retrospect that be the funniest thing I have ever see in my entire life how perfect be that he have a vanload of little kid and he get black coffee the one thing from mcdonald  no child could enjoy my dad be coldbloode he once shush a kid during lion king on broadway that actually happen we be at lion king on broadway and there be a fiveyearold behind we go look it be pumbaa look it be timon and my dad turn around and say be you go to talk the entire time he be my hero the weird thing when I be a kid be how much they scare we about smoke weed they scare we about it constantly and I ve be on tour this year  marijuana be legal in   or   state in some form or another it be insane yeah well  all right do not whoo if you be white it be always be legal for we come on sir we do not go to jail for marijuana you silly billy when I be arrest with a onehitter at a rust root concert I do not serve hard time I think I get an award eighteen or   state and by the way I agree it be a very good thing but it be also a really weird thing because this be the first time I ve ever see a law change because the government be just like fine you know I ve never see it before like gay marriage and healthcare we have to battle it out in the supreme court and be like gay people be human and they be like we will think about it but with weed it be just something we want really badly and we keep ask they for   year like excuse I and then suddenly the government become like cool parent and they be just like okay here take a little we would rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else  blah blah blah blah blah those stupid parent and that be a big deal because they scare we about weed constantly it would be on our sitcom we would be watching save by the bell we would be have a great old time and then suddenly a character we have not see before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its track and they would always hold the joint  the bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way they would always offer the joint in a way that no one ever hold a joint like it be a skull in a shakespeare play and now it be legal and that be great news unless you be a weed dealer and then it be terrible news and I do not just mean because they be about to lose out to amazoncom I more feel bad for weed dealer cause they be about to find out that we only show they a certain amount of politeness because they have an illegal product and we do not show that same politeness to people who deliver legal product like when the chinese food delivery guy come we do not let he hang out after he be deliver the chinese food and we do not look the other way when he say weird shit to the girl we be hang out with  to try to preserve the relationship and we definitely do not give he some of the chinese food he be never like hey can I get in on those dumpling and we be like yeah we be all friend what be you on your phone hey vneck hey   what be your name   sam sam cool what do you do to afford vneck sam type number ah  number the letter of math I be sorry to bother you I do not mean to single you out I hate when people get pull out of the audience like be you familiar with the cirque du soleil sam they be a group of french asshole that be slowly take over america by humiliating audience member one by one we once go to see cirque du soleil at navy pier when I be a kid and my brother come and he be   year old you remember be   when you be like no one look at I or I will kill myself and these french bastard come into the crowd be like le volunteer and they pull my brother up on stage and I be like no and they bring he up and they reach into his sweatshirt and they be like  and they have plant a bra and they pull out a bra and they be like  and everyone at navy pier be like ah ha ha ha ha and my brother be like that be great I have have other job besides comedy I be an office temp for a while I really miss that I love be a temp because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week and then you just get to retire like lou gehrig you be like thank you no one will ever see I again and they be like goodbye I work at an office once on   street in new york city I be there for a couple week I be in a cubicle next to this other cubicle this woman name mischa sit in the other cubicle I want to get the number right I think mischa have  about   photo of her daughter up in her cubicle almost like she be try to solve a conspiracy about her daughter a beautiful mindstyle I think about mischa two time a week  because of a phone call she have next to I one day it be one of my first day and I be sit next to she and her phone rang and this be her call and I be quote her phone rang and she say hello hush and then she hang up think about that two time a week and I do not know she well enough by then to be like hey what kind of a person be you you know who could she have be talk to hello hush this be a place of business my only thought be that it be the ceo of the company be like mischa help I be do a crossword puzzle I need a fourletter word for  be quiet  right now   hush   you be promote I tempe at a little web company on   street in new york city it be a small web company own by this old man who be old old old money new york his name be henry j finch iv like old old old money like his money be in molasse or something he own this web company I have no idea why he own this web company I think he win it in a rich man  game of dice and small binocular or something mr finch wear linen suit he have suspender he have a bow tie he have a hat he have a cane with an ivory handle I be give you more description than you need cause I need you to believe I this be a real person I know in the   century mr finch be in his   he have an assistant name mary she be in her   she be korean I do not know why he have an assistant he do not need one unless he need someone to be like remember mr finch at five oclock you need to keep look like a hardboiled egg one day mr finch come into the office it have be rain everything I be about to say to you be say in front of I on that afternoon mr finch walk into the office and he be wear a raincoat he be wear a rain hat and he have his cane and he walk in and he say and I be quote ah one feel like a duck splash around in all this wet and when one feel like a duck one be happy and then mary yell ooh duckling to which mr finch reply too old to be a duckle quack quack and then walk into his office I think about that every goddamn day I mean imagine you be I you be a yearold temp and you be so hungover and you just wanna die every day and then that happen in front of you and I do not know give you hope and I do that a little fast let I break that conversation down for you mr finch walk in and he begin a conversation the way anyone would ah one feel like a duck splash around in all this wet the rain and when one feel like a duck one be happy now that be debatable but rather than debate that point mary bring up a new separate but interesting point  which be duckling but mr finch ever the realist about his own age and mortality  say ah too old to be a duckling as if to say my duckle day be behind I mary do not you see I be a duck now and to prove it  well I will say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck have   quack quack and I know right at that moment by the way that it mean nothing to mr finch what he have say crazy people be like that they have unlimited crazy currency like if I have go into his office a couple week later and be like hey finch you remember that time you be like  too old to be a duckle quack quack  he would just be like ah perhaps I do quack but such be life for an old knickerbocker like I like he would say something else crazy that be the wonderful thing about crazy people you know be that they just have unlimited currency the thing they say mean nothing to they but they mean everything to I I be once walk into penn station in new york I be walk down   street towards eighth avenue I be walk down   there be this woman stand at eighth and   I have my little roller suitcase you can all imagine I be walk towards she she be smoke a cigarette that be not light anymore she be watch I walk kind of scan I up and down as if she have terminator vision  where she could see little bit of datum like little honky ass and could read information as I walk past she she say this to I I walk past she and she say and I be quote eat ass suck a dick and sell drug very dirty yes a very upsetting thing to hear yes I be sorry you all have to hear that but at least you all get to hear it as a group I be alone out there that afternoon and she say this totally unprompted eat ass suck a dick and sell drug it be not like I have pause in front of she and be like what should I do with my life so I walk away from she with this todo list and I like structure I like a todo list it do dawn on I that that list of thing do get well as it go along when you really think about it  cause it start in a pretty rough place it start with just about the bad task a todo list can start with but by the end you have your own small business and be not that the american dream when all be say and do that if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick one day you can sell drug imagine you do all that to sell drug and then they legalize drug and you be like but I  this have be a real thrill to perform here by the way I just wanna say that in all sincerity thank for come to this really really appreciate it I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here about the night I meet a guy name bill clinton now I do not  some of you know who that be for those of you that do not he be president of the united state from   until   and he be a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declare emperor of the united state of america now I know you know who bill clinton be but I be do a show at a college and I mention bill clinton and like they kind of do not know who he be like sorry they know the name right but they only know this   bill clinton who be a very different bill clinton have you see his ass lately what the hell be he try to pull he be all thin now and he wear these little tight suit and he be get these grandpa read glass like hey I ca not do nothing to nobody no more oh I I be just an old old man I do not have the appetite you know and he be always fly around the world with bill gate try to cure aid that be not the bill clinton that we all sign up for   year ago our bill clinton be like a big fat buddy garrity from friday night lightslooking guy who play the saxophone on arsenio and his work in the std community be not in cure anything at that time that be the man we all elect president that be the bill clinton that I meet I get to meet bill clinton when he be governor clinton in   when he be first run for president and I get to meet bill clinton because my parent have go to the same college as bill clinton they be a little young but they go to the same college so when he be first run for president he would have all these big like alumnus fundraiser and everyone who go be invite to go now this be really cool for a couple reason one I get to meet bill clinton but two I get to watch my parent watch someone they go to school with become the president and that be super funny to see cause think about some of the people you go to school with now imagine they be become the president imagine sam be become the president it would stir up strong emotion and my parent have very different opinion on bill clinton my mom love bill clinton cause bill clinton be always a really charismatic handsome guy I mean think about how many woman he get in the   when he look like frank caliendo do john madden now  imagine he as a college student and my mom tell I that there be this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then where late at night if female student be leave the library unaccompanie male student be encourage to wait out in front and offer to walk they home that sound good right so my mom tell I that bill clinton would be out in front of the library every single night  just be like hey can I walk ya home hey can I walk ya home hey can I walk ya home hey can I walk ya home and one night my mom be leave the library and bill clinton be like hey can I walk ya home and my mom be like hell yes so  this be absolutely true my mom little ellen stanton walk arminarm with bill clinton to her dorm and she be like you know I want to invite he up for a beer and I be like thank I be nine but  her roommate be upstairs so she lose her chance with bill clinton now my dad on the other hand hate bill clinton because my parent be date during this time and also my dad be a much more morallyupright conservative kind of guy he always tell I that he hate it in college that bill clinton could quote get away with anything can you imagine how he feel later so one day this invitation arrive for a fundraiser where you could meet bill clinton my mom open it first and she go oh we have to go we have to go see bill and without look up at she my dad just say why it be not like he be gon na remember you one black coffee same motherfucker so my mom say fine I will go and I will take john and I be like hell yeah and I slide in the room in my first communion suit ready to go  cause I love bill clinton I be ten year old if you be a kid when bill clinton be first release it be the most exciting thing ever we have never see a cool politician before and he would go on mtv and he would have cool answer to kid  question they would be like governor what be your favorite food and he would be like I do not know fry and we would be like yay we eat fry I learn to play his campaign song on the piano it be do not stop by fleetwood mac  from rumour an album write by and for people cheat on each other he let we know who he be right away so I go with my mom as her date  to reconnect with governor bill clinton we walk into the ballroom it be a big hotel ballroom it be the palmer house hilton big hilton hotel ballroom walk into the ballroom it be pack with people it be actually the ballroom from the end of the movie the fugitive remember so that ballroom so my mom and I walk in it be pack with people

pressure he to do it so you know I just have this wacky woman  intuition that be how proposal really work ok a woman have to incept the idea into the man  head first passively and then if he do not get the message extremely aggressively you got ta threaten to leave without ever actually leave because you know that you be too old and it be too late to go back out there and find a new man and

afterwards and there would be that snailtrail in between your finger oh my god it be so juicy you could just blow a bubble wand with it just  I slime you I slime you ghostbuster I do not know what kind of mother I be gon na be I be I be   and I do have to get a little bit of science involve when try to get pregnant and a lot of that  be most likely my fault because when I be in my   I eat plan b like skittle so my uterus probably look like a smoker  lung and I find out that my progesterone level be alarmingly low so then I have to take these hormone pill that be suppository and push pop they up myself every single night and then at my writing job at fresh off the boat I would be storyboarde in front of my coworker and then at some point the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear and I have to act like everything be ok when everything be clearly not ok and then a side effect of the progesterone be that it make I extremely itchy so then I have to find way to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table and then resist the urge to immediately smell my finger afterwards I want to be able to smell my finger when I wanna smell my own goddamn finger housewife they can just scratch and sniff all day long they just vacuum scratch sniff they make a sandwich uh mmm they watch property brother scratch what be crackin  mmm every time you scratch yourself all you can think about be when can I smell my finger when can I smell my finger when can I discretely find a way to   smell my finger nature make you urgently curious to protect you cause you got ta check that it be all good in the hood if it be too funky you need to see a doctor your finger be your first webmd when my husband and I be try to have a kid a lot of people be like oh my god that be so hot you guy doin a lot of fuckin  no dude that be that be shit you do in your   ok when in when you be in your   and you ve be try to get pregnant for a while it get very clinical you pee on these ovulation strip that tell you when the egg be droppin  it tell you when it be easter time and I would only fuck he when it be easter time it be like only four day out of the month and outside of that I would be like we be not fuckin  I need you to save it I want your sperm to be as pentup and as angry and rapey as possible so that when they come out it be like  release the kraken and they just come out like a bunch of angry refugee escape a dictatorship you know and um  yeah and most of the time like we would not even have sex cause I be so tired when I would come home and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip and I would be like ok it be go time and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time and he would close his eye immediately I know what that mean ok when somebody close their eye during sex it be not because they be in such ecstasy with you that that they need to close their eye when somebody close their eye during sex it be because they be literally try to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two latina lesbian that they see early that day on redtube onto the back of their eyelid which be fine by I because then he do not have to see the expression on my face that say please hurry the fuck up and then when he be about to finish I could always tell because the indication be very universal when a man be about to finish it be when they get that  that stupidass look on their face   where they look like they just get bit by a zombie just  and then because we be hippie I would be like hey hey please look I in the eye and remember to come with intention ok and then I would jump on he and hold onto his neck and I would just twerk twerk twerk the shit out of he  and do some of this shit that I learn in atlanta and then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards  to make sure all of that harvard nectar would just drain inside of I that be right  cause I do not wanna work anymore I be very grateful to be pregnant and to be  this far along to be seven and a half month pregnant because last year I have a miscarriage which be very common and a lot of woman who be in their   flip out when they hear that they be like oh my god that be so dark and terrible I ca not believe that I be   girl when you be   you will know plenty of woman who have have a miscarriage it be super common and I

the pain away a lot of woman try to freak I out they try to freak I out about childbirth by say ali do you know that you be gon na poop on the table I be like yeah I look forward to it I be all back up from hold in my shit at work I ca not wait to cleanse it make sense like that you that that happen because when you be in labor you push you push you push and your husband will be ask to assist in the labor by lift up your leg which subsequently turn into a soft serve lever you just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life and just when you think that be enough to make he finally leave you boom a baby come out and he get ta stay that be the real miracle of life right there I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage because the baby have not even come out yet and I be already so resentful towards my husband so much resentment especially when he ask I to do shit around the house hey can you wash the dish no can you water the plant I be not do jack shit anymore I be busy makin  a eyeball ok be you makin  a foot I do not think so you change the channel I can already see how there be like this crazy double standard in our society of how it take so little to be consider a great dad and it also take so little to be consider a shitty mom people praise my husband for come to all of my doctor  appointment with I oh my god I ca not believe he come to all your doctor  appointment he be so supportive guess who else have to go to those doctor appointment I I be the star of the show there be nothing for the camera to see if I be not there but he be the hero for play candy crush while I get my blood draw meanwhile if I do mushroom seven month pregnant I be a bad mommy you know I I I like I berate my husband on like a daily basis partially because I really be mad at he but mostly out of survival because if he leave I I be fuck so I have to chip away at his selfesteem on a daily basis  to keep he down so that he do not believe that he be worthy of another woman  affection and leave I I get ta keep he around by keep he down people do not tell you about all this shit that go down with your body when you get pregnant you know your nipple get huge and dark I do not know that I do not know that they get dark so that the baby can see like a bullseye so that the baby can find it easy and then you know they get big they get big like finger like you you you owe I money you my nipple look like whopper now and naked I look like a minion but I be not gon na be one of those crazy pregnant lady who try to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant no hopefully if you see I in a year I will have the kind of body where if I do a nude scene on television people will commend I for be courageous for do it now that I be seven and a half month pregnant my pussy  all wet again but it be different it be not like when I be   year old when it be like really hot you know and I be like why be it different and I look it up and my pussy  all wet again because my my body  secrete mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attack it that be not the same when it be straight up soldier glue when it be neosporin so you know I I in previously before I meet my husband I have date a bunch of loser and then I meet this dream guy who be like way more handsome than I out of my league graduate from harvard business school work hard to trap his ass get he to propose to I oh my god then we got marry all my dream come true and then we get pregnant and recently we buy our first home together and uh two week into the escrow process I discover

grandfather gasp at his own wife  funeral   at a methodist church in vicksburg mississippi  you be not a real comedian I be a real comedian I be a pure comedian I think I be one of the good comedian of all time but here be the thing it do not matter if you believe I it really do not matter the important thing be that I would pass a lie detector test I like to test myself I like to test myself by joke about horrible thing and nothing but one of my favorite way to test myself I like to joke about tragedy the day that they happen the day they happen I do not believe in too soon I be on a tight schedule and I be good at it I be good at it like the day of  the day of the aurora colorado batman movie theater shoot the day it happen I go online I go on twitter and I tweet other than that how be the movie right right nail it nail it and the reason I get away with that  the reason I get away with stuff like that be I be just the guy who do it people be use to it from I it would be weird if I do not make a joke the day of a tragedy which be why I be very surprised when I get in a lot of trouble the day of the boston marathon now I do not follow the news regularly but I know the second a tragedy happen because I get   text message say do not do it and whenever I see that  whenever I see that it make I sad it make I sad cause I know something horrible have happen people will say anthony what be funny about aurora what be funny about the boston marathon what be funny about your grandmother  funeral nothing nothing be funny about those thing that be where I come in so I see these text and I be like oh no what happen but I also think I ve get a job to do so I go online I start read about it I do not want to watch the footage but I will read about what happen and I think how can I make someone laugh today and then I think I get it I go back on twitter and I tweet guy today there be just some line that should not be cross especially the finish line and again I think nail it usa usa but then my phone start to ring and it be my boss or should I say my former boss and they say anthony this be unacceptable you be not just a comedian today you be also the host of your own tv show with your name in the title on our network you take this joke down right now or you be fire and I say go fuck yourself and I mean it I do not get into comedy for money or fame I know that sound wrong because I be dripping with both I only get into this business so that no one could tell I what to do and they say  sure they say well anthony you do not understand you do not understand at all if you do not take this joke down right now if you do not delete this joke right now not only be you fire but the entire cast and crew of your television show about a hundred people they be also out of a job and I be ashamed to tell you this I be embarrassed to admit it but in that moment I fold and I delete the joke  cause I be happy to fight for what I believe in I be happy to take the consequence for what I ve do but what I could not do can not do be walk up to my cameraman and say hey buddy no work for you on monday I have this sweet tweet could not do it but as soon as I hit delete I get mad and I regret it I would fire every single one of those fuck asshole now I will tell ya that and I get mad for betray myself and everything I believe in I be just as mad today as I be then just as mad so mad I have to have a meeting with the network where they call I in for a little lecture they be like anthony we be family why be you so upset ca not you see we do you a favor do not you worry about your career let I ask you san francisco do I seem like I worry about my career no you know why people who win the lottery always end up go bankrupt because if they be worried about their money they would not have play the lottery in the first fuckin  place I do not worry about my career and they say anthony the problem be when you make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy it seem like you be make fun of the victim and that be wrong but that be not what I be do because you see the day of a tragedy victim be not on twitter be I wrong tell I I be wrong the day of a tragedy victim have get victim shit to do no one be ever  no one be ever put on a tourniquet ask hey be we trend no this be who I be make fun of when I make a joke on twitter the day of a tragedy the people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the internet and they run to their social medium facebook twitter whatever they get and they all write down the exact same thing my thought and prayer  my thought and prayer with the people in aurora my thought and prayer with the family in boston do you know what that be worth fuck nothing fuck less than nothing less than nothing you be not give any of your time your money or even your compassion all you be do all you be do be say do not forget about I today do not forget about I lot of crazy distraction in the news but do not forget how sad I be those people be worthless and they deserve to be make fun of they be like a wedding photographer who only take selfie you understand now I be sure everyone here have tell a joke before where nobody laugh at it it be fine it be embarrassing but it be fun you can laugh at yourself it be not a reason to stop tell joke maybe some of you have tell a joke before where someone get mad at you for it trust I that be fun too you guy ever tell a joke and then get death threat well I guess that be what make I I on my television show I once do a segment that air once and only once before it be ban call shark party all right now  some of you enjoy it but if you ve never see shark party you can never see shark party it be be wipe off the face of the earth by the power that be so I will explain it to you I love shark I love shark more than anything people  people I can barely fuck tolerate every single year   million shark be kill by human being every year    people kill by shark so when I hear about a shark attack I be like fuck yeah win one for the home team so as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want I say you know what I want to have a shark party as soon as there be a shark attack we be have a shark party and I get lucky about a month into my run this guy from new zealand gets eat by a great white the champagne of shark and I know exactly what to do I ve already get the script write I walk on stage in front of the camera I say lady and gentleman this guy from new zealand have be eat by a great white shark it be time for a shark party light go down music come up six woman wear shark dress come out on either side of I and we all start dance for way too long a stripper wear a giant shark head run out and give I a lap dance very tasteful and

Mike Birbiglia,wow hey thank you thank thank you guy hey seattle nice to see you look at this look at we we be here this be crazy it be insane so about five year ago pretty much everyone who I know start to get married and that be strange for I because I do not really believe in the idea of marriage and that would have be fine except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I be right about something it can be a real source of tension between I and the person I be argue with and the reason it be a source of tension be that I be right and so I remember distinctly talk to my friend dana and she go well you do not believe in marriage for you but of course you believe in it for other people and I be like no I think it be insane you know for anyone and she say why and I say well first of all it just seem doom you know   of marriage end in divorce that be just first marriage by the way second marriage   to   end in divorce third marriage   to   end in divorce that be a learn curve second of all monogamy  impossible or at the very least not a sure thing when I say that I think people assume that I be imply that man be incapable of be faithful I think woman be just as incapable but for more sophisticated reason you know I mean with man we be just really simple we have a very simple sexuality when I say that my female friend be like well we like sex just as much as you do and I say sure but it be different and they say how and I say have you ever masturbate while drive a car number three  I be never gon na be happy why would anyone want to be a part of that I think that be not bring up often enough I um I do not know that would be the reaction oh no that be the hopeful part the uh  I have one ally in all this which be my friend andy and he be a comedian as well not only do we decide we be not gon na get marry we actually try to stop other people we know from get married yeah we be pretty good at it like we stop or put on hold three or four marriage you know we be  we be pretty good I mean we be not like the good in the world I be sure there be well in europe but we be  we be solid you know like so like for example at point my friend alex be about to get engage and so we just take he to dinner and during dessert we give he a long hard stare we say be you sure this be what you want to do and then we go cold to give he the sense of what it would feel like when we be not friend anymore so february    I be at andy  house in los angele and early in the night I get in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone and it be a bad one because I know that I be right and andy be a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation cause he be the kind of friend who just take your side regardless of whether you be right he say stuff like she sound crazy like even if what she be say be not that crazy like you would be like she only eat whole wheat bagel he would be like she sound crazy you would be like that be not even the crazy part you know so I be tell he about his argument and he go you be right I go I know I be right he go yeah you be right I go I know I be right I get to tell she about this in the morning and I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel and I be drive out of andy  small road and I be tbone I do not know if you be familiar with this term uh  this be the culinary way of describe when you be hit by another car driver  side at a degree angle like a tbone steak and in    second I be spin around and I think I be dead no wait I be paralyzed and then I hear nothing and then I hear the other car skid out and drive away I know let I tell you how this argument start I meet jenny in st louis my friend andy and I be work for her company they be perform for a bunch of wrestling coach which be really my demographic I uh  no I be very nervous about this I be actually kind of about to go onstage and I be like scrawl note on my napkin a lot of time I will write kind of manic note on napkin or hotel stationary and jenny look at I and she go what be you do and I say I be write my set list and then she go I think it will be fine and I be like no it wo not be fine and then she be like I think it will be okay and I say why do you think that and she say well you look so nervous I think they will feel sorry for you but jenny have this really soft sweet voice like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with say anything at one point she say it seem like you comedian be a lot funny onstage normally I would be offend by that but in this instance I be like you be right that be a great point you be beautiful you know she re  she really be you know from the moment I meet jenny I know I want to sleep with she at least once stay with I uh I mean  I mean that in like in the most meaningful way like that be the most that I be capable of in my life at that point I  I would jus  I would just come off a really long difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we be gon na get married and  and then we be not and then when we be not I be so heartbroken I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even live with someone entirely you know and  but from the moment I meet jenny I just want to be with she and I do not  I do not think it be gon na happen like I do not have that kind of confidence I actually think of myself as a sex maybe which be to say that if I be see a girl she would think I would have sex with he maybe you know and I be  I be not ashamed of that there be period in my life where I be a sex never or a sex with self always yeah and often surprisingly often yeah I just do not give off a great first impression like I will give you an example like this be the shirt I decide to wear tonight like I do not  I do not spill mustard on the real shirt and this be the backup shirt I mean this be my a outfit my b outfit be naked I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixerupper I ve reach this point in my life I do not really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment I glance at it to make sure I be not bleed you know what I mean like  but I do not stare at the mirror if I stare at the mirror I get angry like I feel like I be complain about a bad call a ref just make I be like come on you be blind if you be leave the house like that and the ref be god and the compete team be my gut and my recede hairline and it be a close game cause my gut be large and my hairline be fast and I be all rile up I be about to charge the field and the guy come by with fried dough and I be like next time you know that be how I go for fried dough cause I have a problem I just  this be ridiculous can you follow I over here for a second I be gon na jump off stage this be only in seattle where someone be wear no shoe no shoe or sock what who be you people what be wrong with you I would expect that behavior from this guy but not you sir not you what be this where do you think you be from seattle yeah seattle so I ve be go uh recently to a woman  exercise class iive give up on have a traditional male physique and so now I be go for strong independent woman and uh  it be go pretty well you know I be not as good in the class as you might think sometimes I will kind of skip whole section of the more difficult exercise when the instructor be not look but then when she look over I always have to strike a pose as though I ve be do what everybody else have be do it remind I of the olympic you know how they do gymnastic how they will have those  the girl will do those crazy flip and twirl and every once in a while  and I be not say I root for this to happen but sometimes they will fall and it be ugly cause they be roll around like I be in a lot of trouble like I do not even know how I get here but at the end of that no matter what  and I totally fall for it I be like that ca not possibly be the same loser from moment ago I mean that be a completely different person this person have much well posture for starter I really want jenny to come out with I and andy that night in st louis cause we be go out to one of these famous irish pub where no one can hear anyone speak and so I think that might work to my advantage I do not know and uh  I do not have the nerve to ask she myself and so I convince andy to ask she for we and uh  pfft which  yeah I do not know if that be the good idea cause uh we be head  we be in the car head to the pub and jenny say oh I leave my i d at the hotel and I be like oh we can just swing back and get it and she be like  she be like no it will be fine I be like no it wo not be fine cause it be st patrick  day and there be bouncer and she go no it will be okay and I be like no it wo not be okay and then we get to the pub and it be fine like the bouncer just kind of wave she through which have not be my experience with bouncer for I bouncer be like prison guard and for jenny they be like birthday clown like you know what can I do to make your day well you know and that be  we be at the pub and it have take so much convincing for andy to get jenny to come out there by the time she come out she think she be on a date with he and yeah that be not the idea and so I say  I have to convince he to fall away as the night go on like the red rocket on the space shuttle and eventually she realize she be on a date with I and she be not happy about that but uh  but she warm to I as the night go on cause she be drink and then like  no by the end of the night we be laugh and have a good time and we  I catch a break which be we share a ride back to our hotel with one of their friend and she and I be stuff in this little back seat together and it be really quiet so I could hear her soft voice and she tell I she have just come off a long difficult breakup and I tell she about my breakup and for a moment there in the back seat it feel like we be hold up two half of a break paper heart and  we get back to the hotel and I offer to walk she to her room and she say sure we get to her door and I do not want this night to end and so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss she and she say oh no thank you which I think be polite  but disappoint I mean there be something about a reject kiss that be the most personal type of rejection because you be really put yourself out there you be just like I think we should connect mouth you know and  the other person  like I do not think we should connect mouth and those be  they be two very different mouth agenda you know and then you just feel so stupid you be like I never should have suggest we connect mouth you know this be a sore subject for I I have sort of a long history of fail kiss like I  I remember grow up like when people start make out like in my time in massachusett it be in seventh grade I remember  I remember it like it be yesterday cause I be shocked I be like people we know be just make out with other people we know but how you know it seem like an alien ritual where these two alien just attach orifice all of a sudden I be like I be not do that and collectively all the girl in my class be like that be fine you be not on the list you be not exactly a firstround draft pick for our new activity I be like perfect it seem so gross to I and it still do kind of like sometimes you hear these homophobic argument from these guy who be like I do not like when I see two dude make out in the street and I feel that way about anyone like make out be just sloppy it be like watch a dog eat spaghetti that be how I make out be that right do anybody know if that be right okay good so  in seventh grade I be like I be not gon na make out with anybody and that be fine for a while but increasingly it kind of divide the class into two distinct part it be like the makeout club and the nonmakeout club and these be informal organization of course I mean I would be sad if that be schoolsanctione like we call this meeting of the nonmakeout club to order first order of business nintendo second order of business why do not anyone like we meet adjourn I do not know it be a sad group and we be lose good guy by the day I fear  I fear that soon I would be the lone member of the nonmakeout club so I be like I get to try to get into the makeout club but it be a very intangible goal I do not really talk to a lot of girl and  there be one girl who sit in front of I in class name lisa bazetti who I have a huge crush on but she be way out of my league like she have many suitor she have  I do not  the rest of the show be in old english uh  she doth have many suitor uh no she have many you know admirer and there be three of we really and I be in third place in all the trade publication but I have one advantage over these other guy which be she have to talk to I on the phone every night about homework thank to alphabetical order bazetti birbiglia one time I say something on the phone that make she laugh and I be like oh this be great I get to do that more and one time we be on the phone and she be laugh so hard I remember so well cause she go mike you got to stop I be gon na pee myself and I be like wow this be the close I would ever come to a vagina so spend the next   year try to get lisa bazetti to pee and that be how I end up here yeah that be how we all end up here in a sense so  uh  so here be what happen with lisa one time I build up the courage to ask she to go to the carnival with I and she say yes I could not believe it like all of a sudden I think well maybe this will be like one of those romantic comedy montage we will go to the carnival we will get stuck on the top of the ferris wheel we will make out it will all take a minute and a half and it will be set to phil collin song but I think that when you be   year old you just do not understand certain thing about your digestive system you do not know that you should not eat popcorn and peanut and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine call the scrambler cotton candy be the most insane of these item it be basically say we be gon na take sugar which everyone know be bad but then we will dress it up like insulation and I be like I be not sure what the selling point be there be it the sugar or the insulation they be like we already sell it I be like well do way to move the product before the information campaign disseminate I do not know if you have the scrambler here in seattle I imagine you might it travel on a truck it be a very mobile scramble unit the premise be very simple you just sit on a twoperson pod with the person you be in love with and that pod go in a circle which be part of a large circle which be part of an even grander circle as I understand it it be originally design as a medical device for constipate patient it be call the shit of pantserator and it be wildly successful and then it be coopte by the carnival worker of america cwoa and they say  they say we like it but we do feel like the name be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy say well what about the  I think I be gon na dieerator  and they be like that be good cause it get across the essence of how you feel when you be on the machine plus it have the add wordplay with diarrhea which be a nice homage to the original intention of the machine but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff and then one guy go well what about the scrambler  cause it scramble you they be like we get it frank but who  frank be a maniac this guy ca not be stop but every once in a while he be get a good idea but who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment and this one guy go well I have a nephew who be   year old and smoke pot   hour a day I feel like he might be available and they be like he sound amazing we do not even need to interview he he sound completely qualified I sit down with lisa on the scrambler and I be feel good like she be snuggle up close to I and I be think  I be think like this could be it this could be where it be all gon na happen this be very special and then they put that bar seat belt down and the bar seat belt be not a reassuring piece of safety equipment it be not a ralph nader approve item I do not think it be save life I think the only thing it be ever do be in a scrambler accident it be just sort of hold someone  esophagus down to the pavement making sure that they be dead and that they can not talk about the scrambler accident first rule of scrambler accident do not talk about scrambler accident that be from scrambler club well I know from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I be go to throw up for sure and I even say to the yearold stoner I be like hey actually  and then he be go apparently he do not enjoy the second half of sentence so then I be scramble and  as I be scramble I be think I need to come up with a plan of some kind I be not go down without a fight my first plan be very simple it be just do not look at lisa do not look at any other people I be like do not look at lisa do not look at any other people do not look at lisa do not look at any other people I need a new plan and  the new plan be I need to tell the scrambler operator  that he need to stop the ride but  the mathematic of the scrambler be such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator be a very limited window so I be like I get to tell he he be get to stop the ride I get to tell he he be get to stop the ride I get to tell he he be get to stop the ride please stop the ride and I be back I be not sure he hear I I get to say it louder please stop the ride I be not sure he be pay attention I think he might be smoke pot right now the third time I say please stop and then I start throw up and it be not unlike an oscillate lawn sprinkler just  popcorn peanut  insulation really insulate the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa I do not look at lisa but I be pretty sure she be stare at I because I be a spectacle at that point I be spectacular and we do not make out I do not lose my mouth virginity that evening two year later it get bad um  I be at the st john  high school what they call a cattle call dance this be an all boy catholic school I attend where they would invite the girl from all over the state to our sweaty st john  gymnasium like cattle which be a friendly way to describe woman you know so  cattle show up at   we will make out with the cattle cattle go home at   then we go out for burger completely separate from the cattle analogy it be a horrible affair it be just like this room chockfull of sweat and hormone and drakkar noir and lead zeppelin and make out at this point I be indeed the lone member of the nonmakeout club but it be actually bad than that cause I have to lie to my friend and tell they I have have my first kiss cause it be like this really tough all boy school and so when they would ask like oh have you have your first kiss I would be like yeah like all the time like every  every week I always fear at some point there would be a followup question like oh yeah what be it like and I would be like yeah you know it be just like lick an ice cream cone and they would be like no it be not it be like suck on a rocket pop and I would be like ah wrong frozen dessert analogy I be at the dance and I be flank by my friend sam ricciardi and we be introduce by our friend tom to these girl from his town they be the last two cow at the dance they be like moo and we be like moo and then sam say one of these phrase I think we ve all hear but be very uncomfortable to repeat he say you get that one which I know it be the bad turn of phrase but I be comfortable say it cause I know I ve be on the negative end of that conversation where a girl say of I you get that one and then her friend go like oof you know or even bad  or even bad like you owe I which really hurt thinking of someone incur debt base on my appearance I would hate to hurt someone  credit score you know so he go  he go you get that one and then I be just fast dancing with this girl sandra to young mc  bust a move and I be not great at fast dancing but they have the strobe light go so it be only catch I one out of every five  hey so she be lose interest but at   the speed and then I be save by a slow song stairway to heaven which be a classic makeout anthem lead zeppelin eight minute long what be great about slow dancing be you ca not really mess it up cause it be just sort of a slowmotion hug like the only way you could mess it up be if you just start fast dancing in the middle of it she would be like what be you do and I would be like I do not pick up on social cue you know but it be such a long song you know stairway so I be just try not to fidget I be sort of a fidgety person I fear if I fidget too much I might initiate the head tilt too early I do not know anything about make out but I would see people do it I could see there be like a head tilt I have hear there be tongue involve and I could see that there be like some kind of space in between the two mouth to I that be the most mysterious part of the whole thing what be happen in that space there be no  you know there be no video documentation of that area it be like the giant squid of make out no one have see it alive they ve only see it wash up on the shore  which be more specific to the squid side of that analogy but  so I be try not to fidget then with    minute leave in stairway to heaven the song hit that crescendo  all around I kid start to make the tilt just a harvest of teenager make out all around I and I be like oh no I do not want to be alone anymore and I make the slight tilt and then sandra come in strong and then it be an allout mouth war and she have artillery cause she have brace it be like a dog eat spaghetti and the fork as this oral atrocity be take place all I can think be I be not alone anymore I be not in the nonmakeout club and all I want to do be tell my friend but I could not because up until that point I would lie and say that I would have my first kiss I walk off the dance floor sam be like how have it go dude I have to be like same as always pretty smooth as the week wear on I start to convince myself well maybe it do go well and I should call sandra and this could bud into a relationship of some kind but  I get her number from tom and those conversation end up be very brief you know we do not have a lot to talk about I remember just be like hey you like full house I neither cool all right later you know what I mean at certain point I remember get this vibe from her kind of like why be you call I and I remember think oh I be probably read into that one too much and  and then she stop call I back and I be like oh yeah I read into that one perfectly but I just feel so dumb about the whole thing and the bad part be I could not even tell my friend until one day I be  I be stand by my locker with my friend tom and so I say to he I be like hey what be go on with sandra like she have not call I back and tom have this know grin on his face I be like what tom be like nothing and I be like what tom be like nothing and I be like what tom  like oh I talk to sandra and she say you be the bad kisser she be ever kiss and it be so devastating cause not only be it probably true but I could not explain to my friend why it be true I could not say that make sense I ve never do that before so instead I have to play it off I have to be like yeah that sound about right I be a terrible kisser that be kind of my thing so I lean in to kiss jenny and she say oh no thank you she agree to go out with I in new york we be both live in new york and she give I her number and I type it in my phone and from that point on she would be jen irish pub nice a few week later I take she out to a restaurant I could not afford to show she how much money I could put on my credit card we be out to dinner and she say to I she go everyone hate I at work and I say why would they hate you I love you she go you love I I go I mean you seem cool I pull it back I do not want to show all my card just about nine of they one of the other thing that she say of note on this date be she say you know sometimes I will date two people at once and that way I be never let down by either person I say that seem like a really smart plan like I would like to do that as well and she say I be still kind of see my exboyfriend john and you can see other people too but you have to tell I if you be see they and I be like all right sound like a plan get it break I get to go find some more people you know and so a few night later I be in another city and I do a show and after the show I go out to a bar and I end up make out with this random girl then a few night later I be out to dinner with jenny and she say how be your trip and I say it be great I do some show and then one night I end up make out with this random girl and that do not go over very well in the conversation I could sense that something be wrong and I be like but I be right about that right like I be suppose to tell you if that happen right and she say yeah but it do not mean that I wo not lose interest in you and I say that be a whole new clause that be a twist what be this the romantic comedy version of the usual suspect I say be you still see john and she say sometimes I say well do not you see the contradiction in that and she say yes and it get very quiet  because we be fall in love three week into my relationship with jenny I build up the courage to ask she to go on a trip to bermuda I want to show she how much more money I could put on my credit card since I do not have a lot leave we go to bermuda cause it be the off season you can get these great deal online because as it turn out when it be winter in new york it be also winter  in bermuda and uh  jenny and I meet up at the airport and she be late which be a big pet peeve of mine I fancy myself as a professional traveler I be always two hour early I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport and I have laceless moccasin I never tell joke about bomb and  and jenny  late and then we get to security and I be not make this up she do not have a license or a passport and I say what do you mean I go how do you travel and she go well usually they let I on the plane with my credit card and my work i d I do not like to dwell on the difference between man and woman but I just ca not imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport and they would let he on the plane but woman get a pass on thing like this that I find completely bewildering I mean if I be in charge of alqaeda for example what  what I would do be I would recruit attractive woman because they be just not stop under any circumstance although it would be difficult to recruit they because all they have to offer be the   virgin and you know the woman would not want that unless they be lesbian although there be an idea you know alqaeda  alqaeda could recruit hot lesbian although  then they would have to guarantee that the   virgin be also lesbian I mean what be the odd you know all   virgin be also lesbian unless you think of sexuality as like a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictate your sexual identity like the   virgin be like I do not even know I be a lesbian until I have sex with that hot lesbian terrorist and now that be all I be into I use to be into these afghani guy who be so crazy they would die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with I and   of my friend but now I do not see khalid in the same way anymore the point be we go to bermuda and we be on the flight  on the flight and the flight attendant come over and she put champagne glass down in front of we and she say congratulation on your honeymoon and we say oh no thank we be not on our honeymoon and she walk away and jenny say that be so funny I do not think I will ever go on a honeymoon and I say oh really and she go yeah I do not think I would ever want to get marry in my life and I say oh really I go I too I say be that base on a principle or do you have a bad relationship like what be your first boyfriend like and  she tell I about her first boyfriend brian it be  they be at the same bus stop when they be   and they would make out on the bus and they be together for six year and they  you know their relationship get deep and they would talk about how they be gon na get marry and spend the rest of their life together and I say then what and she say he die he have leukemia and I say well do you ever talk about this with anyone and she say no I do not really like to talk about it but these be the kind of conversation we start have on this trip where jenny be open up to I and I be open up to she and every night we would be up till   or   in the morning and we be so happy we  at one point I be like well we should do this again we should go on another trip and you could get a license or a passport jenny say that sound great but I do not think I would get a license or a passport cause they do not make I get one and I be like yeah but it be the law you know jenny say yeah I do not think I will get one cause they do not make I get one you know that be how I feel that be how jenny argue thing sometimes she will just say that be how I feel and I will say that be not an argument like we be not even in an argument right now because you do not have an argument and she will say I just win that argument and I will say that be not even possible base on the definition of what an argument be and she will say I just win that argument again that be how I feel you could see how this could be a little bit madden you know uh  on our final day on the trip we get into an argument about essentially nothing she notice there be a basketball court at our hotel and she say we should play and I be like yeah but not like a game and she say why and I say well cause I would win and she say no I think I would win I go no I know that I would win and I know that what I be suppose to say be that  the guy say  I will win  the girl say  I will win  and the guy let her win and then she like he more but I just do not have that in I and jenny go you do not have to let I win let  go out and play and so we go out and play basketball and I just kick her ass I mean it be just like  it be just like    to   you know   to   I mean I be have a good day but still I be just destroy she and at one point she literally say I ve never meet someone who be so obsessed with the score and I say the score be what make it a game so we be argue this over lunch and then again it come up at dinner and then we be still argue about it at   or   in the morning about essentially nothing and she say I do not understand why you be so obsessed with be right I go I be not obsess with it I just be I say why do you think you be right and she say that be how I feel I say if you think I be so wrong about everything why be you even with I and jenny say you ca not choose who you love which be true but it do not mean it be good I remember the first time I fall in love I be in high school and it be that first time where you fall in love and you be just like this be it I find she I be   year old and I be do you know and  her name be amanda and she be like adorable and funny and what be really exciting for I be that she be like a delinquent like I be like this playbytherule school citizen and she have be expel from her previous school for deal acid which I think be a really strong quality like at one point she be like it be totally mess up because it be not even I it be this other girl and I be frame and I be just like awesome like no one would ever frame I for anything I just  I think it be like an opposite attract situation she want to know what it be like to hang out with someone in student government who write for the newspaper and I want to know what it be like to be cool at one point I be like do you want to write an article for the newspaper she go I do not want to write an article I want to do thing people write article about and I be like good answer I find that when you fall in love you tend to overlook certain red flag one of they be that she would say really mean stuff to I but then she would pull it back she would be like no one like you at all only kid or like you be like a nerd but you be not even smart just joke ca not choose who you love second red flag with amanda be that she be a liar and I do not  I do not mean that in an offensive way like lie be kind of like a  it be like a sport at the school I be at I transfer from the all boy school to this coed school there be this one guy in my class name keith robbin who be a legendary liar you would know when he be lie cause he would lick his finger like a bookie and he would dart his eye from side to side and he would go yeah yeah nice nice you know and he be not even handle money like I do not even know what this be about and then he would lie about thing that be sort of insignificant he would be like yeah my uncle  tony robbin motivational speaker yeah nice you know and  we find out that that be not even true but even if that be true that would not be impressive to a bunch of high school student but I think that be the jedi level of lie be you lie about little stuff and no one notice when you be lie about big stuff it be like bank the final red flag with amanda be that she tell I not to tell anyone that she be my girlfriend I know I be in the future also I think we can all see now cause we be so smart and mike be so dumb and uh  you know I can also see in retrospect that be a much big red flag than I perceive it to be at the time but I be so excited she be even with I at all and she say she have another boyfriend at home but they be in the process of break up but it be a bad time cause his parent be sick and so I try to be understanding of that you know I go along with it for a few month until she invite I to meet her parent and I think well this be the affirmation that I need I be gon na be crown as the main boyfriend and I drive my mom  station wagon to amanda  parent  house and I walk in the front door and there be amanda and there be her parent and it be go well and a few hour go by and this other guy come over to the house and his name be scott I be assume he be like a family friend or a relative and slowly I be notice similarity between scott and thing that amanda have say about her other boyfriend they be both in their first year in college and they be competitive wrestler and  it be dawn on I that I be hang out with my girlfriend  boyfriend and it be go pretty well I mean he  he seem like a nice guy I could totally see what she see in he there be some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom she would hold on to my hand and she would say I wish it be just you and I here and I remember think you could make that happen the way she say it be as though she be not involve in the decision process like I would love to but the boy in corporate  well the day take an even strange turn when scott suggest that we go hang out at his house and I meet his parent it be indescribable meeting your girlfriend  boyfriend  parent for the first time part of you be angry for obvious reason but then part of you still want to make a good impression you know you be like  maybe if this go well she will see that I be good with adult in general as a side note his parent seem in perfect health at one point his dad even say to I how do you know amanda and I say we be just friend from school and I be so ashamed and I feel so dumb and I drive home and I remember think I be never gon na let this happen to I again so  ten month into my relationship with jenny she invite I to meet her parent and this be a tricky time at this point our relationship be intense but casual which be a dangerous relationship cocktail and it be a hard thing to organize cause I be away probably five day out of the week and so we find a sunday where I be come back from a fiveday stint in texas which be awful cause it be  in texas and I  that be  that be not to say I dislike texas entirely it be such a large thing to dislike and uh  but that week it feel like texas just dislike I and I just kind of disliked texa back to the point where I develop a small drinking problem which be  which be very popular in texas I be perform at a comedy club now comedy  I love comedy club cause they be sort of a highlow entertainment proposition like in some way though they be the last bastion of free speech and the art of spoken word and then some of they sell dildo straw you know like there be   bachelorette party come through on the weekend and they be hand out gummy penis or whatever that be  that be actually a thing I do not even realize that  I do not realize that that be part of the female fantasy of the penis be  be the gummy quality of the penis I feel like if I be in charge of the candification of the penis it would be hard candy and then if  and then if you suck it down to the gummy part then you just sort of put that off to the side but I  but that be  that be not my job I be  you know I leave that to the expert but I just  I just do the comedy part but I be perform at this club all week and after the late show saturday night I be approach by this bachelorette party that have one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist thing and  I would be drink all week and uh I always try to be a team player you know so I be like whatever I can do to help I do not see how this could end badly and uh  the next morning I wake up in the my hotel room and I be hang over and I be groggy and I roll out of bed and I run to the airport to catch my flight I be still two hour early and  I land in new york and I get a cab to jenny  parent  house and I walk in the front door and there be jenny and there be her parent and there be her other sort of exboyfriend john and he be not front and center like he be just kind of around like he be in the pool like wade and do lap like that kind of thing but I pull jenny aside I be like well what be john do here and she say well he and I be not still together but when we be together he become friend with my stepdad and he be be stay here at their house the last couple week and I say you know that be not good I feel like that give he the edge jenny be stare at I and I say what she say you have a hickey on your neck and I say I do not think that be true and then I glance at the mirror next to I and realize that in fact I do have a hickey on my neck and I say I be really sorry and she say where be that from and I say there be this bachelorette party and I be drunk that sentence never come out right I mean there be no way to deliver that line in a way that make you seem even okay and  we start argue and the argument follow we all the way back to the street in front of my apartment I do not have a leg to stand on I be like well what about john what be he do there she say you have a hickey on your neck I say yeah but at least I tell you the truth and she say eventually and I say eventually be well than never and then she kneed I in the ball I do not know if you ve ever experience this before I be sure half of you have not uh  it be like be electrocute except you do not get to die it be like you want to die but you ca not and there be a person in your face say you deserve this which they would not even do in electrocution I think they would deem that as inhumane    even in texas jenny say I think that we should just break up you know it be not just this I mean you be away a lot of the time and even when you be here you work at night and I work in the day I just do not think it be gon na work out and I say okay    and we be apart for about six month and I miss she so much but I keep resist call she cause I want to give her space and every once in a while I would get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from jen irish pub nice and it would just say hi and I would write back hi it be the small form of communication two people could have with one another but I think in some way keep we together and finally on new year  I cave in and I call she I say hey I really miss you and I want to see you and we get together for coffee and we hit it off just like we use to and we decide we would get back together we have a great period there you know I take she to get a license and a passport first we go for her social security card and then we take that to the dmv and then we mail all of that to the government for a passport it be like the triple crown of identification jenny be wildly identifiable one night she be head back from my apartment to hers and she stop and I say what and she say I think that we should live together and I say no I really do not think that be a good idea you know I ve just decide you know as a principle I be not gon na get married or live with someone it be not personal and she say well unless we live together I just do not think it be gon na work out cause we just do not see each other enough and I do not think that we stand a chance that be how I feel so we move in together and one day jenny get an invitation to the wedding of one of her friend and she invite I to come along and I say oh no thank that do not go over so well she say why and I say well as you know I do not believe in marriage and so I do not buy into the flamboyant pageantry that go into celebrate it she say well what do you believe in and I say I do not know she say well if you do not believe in anything how can you not believe in marriage and I say well first of all you know it just do not seem necessary I mean be it  you know marriage be an archaic institution invent in the middle age base on exchange property I do not want to be a part of that second of all I do not even think we have a common cultural understanding of what marriage even be I mean one of I and andy  friend be about to get engage and we be skeptical and we say  be you sure this be the person you want to be with for the rest of your life  and he go  yeah I think so  and we say  well what if she get in a car accident and she be disfigure would you stay with she then  and he say  maybe  that be not an acceptable answer third of all if I be so in love why do it need to be write into a government contract and I be not one of these like  I do not want government up in my business  kind of people I think the government do a nice job deliver the mail and suggest I do not eat poison but I just do not understand why they need to be involve in my personal relationship then finally if marriage be religious should not I believe in the religion I ve be to more wedding of my friend where the people on the altar do not believe in the religion of the church they ve invite we to some of they even go to class with the priest in advance to more elaborately lie about believe in a religion they do not believe in just to have a wedding in a fancy building that be insane that be how I feel so I explain this to jenny and jenny say well if you ever do want to get marry I would marry you and I say why be not you listen to any of this and jenny say that be how I feel at this point it be   in the morning we would be argue all night and we have not sleep I have to catch a flight at   be out of newark airport to los angele for a show I be do that night at this point I be overtire and I be angry and I be late I be stuff my thing in my roller suitcase and I walk out of our apartment it be   be that part of the morning before the earth even exist before they program the matrix or whatever you walk out of your apartment part of the road be not even there there be a guy with a laptop go we need a road stat what be the code for building tank you know and I get to the airport the news have not even start yet it be just an anchor look around like what be you up to and I get to the kiosk and I print up my ticket and I bring it to the security lady and she look at I and she go well that ai not your gate like I guess they change the gate but the way she say it be as though I have participate in the decision of change it I be like I be not involve in this process I be not even ccwould like as though I have go to the kiosk and be like   like hell I be fly out of   and then I photoshoppe my own ticket print it out and be like this be where I be go you know I be not that aggressive as a traveler so I be like well where be this gate she go it be in another terminal you get to take a tram she point to the tram and I start walk my roller suitcase and I hear she say and you well run like I guess I be late at that point so I start run and the roller suitcase do not enjoy run the roller suitcase be like I do not want to run I have wheel and I be like I do not want to run either but this be what we have to do I tell you what when we get to the hotel I will walk you in circle for a few hour then I  I get to the tram and it have that feature where it say how many minute before the next tram arrive and it say zero minute I be like perfect that be exactly how long I want to wait but the tram  ride away I be like that be   minute then it say ten minute and I be experience that psychological downward spiral like oh great I be gon na miss my flight and then I be gon na miss every flight from now on and I be gon na miss my family reunion and then I be not gon na have a family and then I be gon na be a crack whore and it be like all of a sudden I be a crack whore just because I miss this one flight I can feel the cancer form in my body in real time and  I get on the next tram ten minute later and I run to the gate and I be sweaty and I be out of breath but I be on time and I be so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate and I fall asleep and I wake up to the sound of the door shut I jump up and the door be closed and I be on the sad side of the door the happy side have an airplane and a pilot the sad side be I and the cinnabon lady normally I would be very excited if it be just I and the cinnabon lady I be a big fan of pastry the size of a baby that have enough calorie for a year I think that be an effective use of time but in this instance I need someone who could communicate with the people on the plane and the cinnabon lady be not very well connected in the airline community I be like do you know these people she be like all I know be the white stuff go on the cinnamon bun I run up to the giant glass window I start pound on the window like in a romantic comedy I be like draw barrymore  character come back she do not come back and I miss my flight I get on the next one they could get I on there be a stopover in texas you know how I feel about texas and uh I get to los angele late that night and I would miss my show I would never miss one of my show before and I be so angry and jenny be call I but I be not pick up the phone cause I be blame this entire day on she I get back to my friend andy  house and I say andy this relationship be mess up my entire life and andy go you be right I go I know I be right he go yeah you be right I go I know I be right I get to tell she about this in the morning I drive out of andy  small road and I be tbone that be the culinary way of describe it in    second I be spin around and I think I be dead no wait I be paralyzed and then I hear nothing then I hear the other car skid out and drive away   minute later I be sit on a curb at this point the police have arri  have arrive as well as my friend andy and that be when I start cry you know how when you drop a baby on the ground it do not  do not start cry right away because it do not understand the concept of drop a baby on the ground until it see your face and then it be like oh I guess I should be do something that match that waah I be cry because I be look at my totaled car in front of I and realize that in that moment I might have cease to exist like I say early I do not really believe in anything so in my mind that would have be the end of all thing I would experience in my life every kiss or fail kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion and  the officer come over and he say what happen and I say I got hit by this car and then I hear nothing and then I hear the other car skid out and drive away the officer point over to the light the other car have make a right turn at the light and veer into this very skinny tree I ca not help but think that be karma that be a hit and run and hit and then the officer put this form in my face and he go sign this and I say well what do it mean and he go it mean you be okay and that we can leave I be really shake up I be like I do not know if I be okay and he goes just sign it which be a very unattractive quality when someone just repeat a command that you ve just say no to and it be unattractive but very effective you know I sign it andy take I to the hospital just as a precaution but we have to wait two hour cause the other driver have beat we there and  eventually we be with the doctor and andy say to he he go well be the other guy drunk and the doctor say well I ca not answer that and andy say be he he use the technique we have learn early and it work you know the doctor say well he be head to jail now and andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boy like case close a few hour later we be back at andy  house it be probably around   in the morning and I have one of these epiphany people sometimes have when they have neardeath experience I say I need to call jenny and tell she that we need to get married and andy say mike  sleep on it and I say no no no this make perfect sense and I pick up my phone and I dial her number and he put his hand over the phone and he say mike  sleep on it he save I the next morning I fly back to new york and a few week later I get a call from my rental car agency explain that the accident report have come back on the accident that I just describe and it have find I at fault and that I owe  and I be not make this up    for the repair on the other driver  mercede suv and I be like well this ca not be happen I explain to the woman I think it be a misunderstanding the other guy be clearly drunk it be definitely not my fault and she say I be really sorry but unless they change the accident report you owe this money so I request the accident report and I be gon na show you the actual accident report tonight I do not know if you ve ever see one of these thing before  but it be a little bit like homework for cop and officer timson not so good with the homework he consistently mix up passenger one and passenger two vehicle one and vehicle two at one point so badly that he say p  that be I  start to go but all of a sudden v  that be I also  come at a high rate of speed crash into he now I be pretty selfdestructive as a person but I would never crash into my own car with my own car nor would I understand how you could do that this part be even crazy the other driver  statement at the scene of the accident be I be on venice go  uh I be not too sure I be go away from the beach I be drive I do not know what happen do I hurt anyone I do not know where I be go but I come from home I have a sip of beer which be really everyone  favorite quantity of beer just the one sip right that be what they serve these day at the homebeachpub so all of it be mine the officer make one key mistake he check the box that find I at fault so I be like I need to get officer timson on the phone so we can clear up this misunderstanding the problem be he keep duck my call and I know cause I be call two or three time a day leave message call department next to his department so he know I be try to reach he and finally after a month of this I get he on the phone and I be so relieved and I explain this misunderstanding and he listen to I and he say do the right thing and pay for the guy  car I know and I mean that be what I say I go be not you listen to any of this I go and this guy be clearly drunk I mean he nearly kill I inch from where he hit and I would be dead right now and he want I to pay for his car do not you see how crazy that be just as one human be to another and he say do the right thing and pay for the guy  car and he hang up the phone and at this point this stop be about money and it be just about stop a man who have no regard for people or the law this be chinatown so I start print up google map of the scene of the accident and california state driving law I be on the phone with lawyer and private investigator there be only one lawyer who would consider the case and he be an accident lawyer and he say do you have any loss of income from the accident and I say no and he say do you have any loss of income from the accident and I say no this be not about money and he do not take the case and this be when I start go completely mad I be up to about   or   be every night just surf the web I get a subscription to a site call netdetectivecom which be a great site for vigilante who have   so now I know this guy  name I know where he live I know what he do for a living and in my mind it become like a trailer for a revenge thriller like jim bosworth think he be gon na get away with this but jim bosworth have another thing come mike birbiglia I be like I be gon na track down jim bosworth I be gon na sue jim bosworth and I be gon na sue the entire los angele police department at this point people stop talk to I entirely my friend would call I like hey what be go on I would be like I will tell you what be go on I would tell they this whole story and they would be like you should get a lawyer I would be like this be way past lawyer a lawyer would not even touch this  cause he would not the only person who would talk to I at this point be jenny one night we be out to dinner at a restaurant and she be talk to I but I be not listen cause I be write down idea I have for the case on my napkin I ve draw out a diagram of the intersection and the angle the car be come from and go to and the lane that we be in the law the other driver break and the phone number I be gon na call that week and I be so angry I be write over my own handwriting to the point where I be rip through the napkin and jenny look at I and she say what be you do and I say well this be my case and she say well why do not you work on that in the morning and I say well which part of this napkin do not you understand jenny say mike  you be right but it be only hurt you and I be just so glad that you be alive and I think that we should focus on that she only have to say it once and I give up the case and I pay for this guy  car july    jenny and I go to city hall and got marry I still do not believe in the idea of marriage and I still do not but I believe in she and I ve give up on the idea of be right thank you guy very much thank you thank you guy so much thank for come here tonight and join I,0.08426866002422245,0.519085116572756

you be not gon na die you be gon na think you be gon na die but everybody live learn some shit we learn some shit from the scary trip see the thing about edible one of the problem with it be illegal be that a lot of we do not have a lot of information that we could use like there be a difference between smoke it and eat it when you smoke it you get thc but when you eat it it be process by your liver and it produce something call hydroxy metabolite that be five time more psychoactive than thc and it let you talk to dolphin   this be a real moment that change my life I be in hawaii and we be on a boat and we be fish we be pull these line behind the boat and I be so high I be try to figure out which way the earth be spin like the boat be go this way and the sun be up there I be like um  for like   minute I be paralyzed so while this be all happen these dolphin just show up and if you ve ever be around wild dolphin they be very trippy it be very different than you expect because they look at you they like check you out they like pop out of the water and they like look at you  like a person not like a fuck deer or woodchuck they look at you like another person grant I be so high I think I be gon na die but  I be make eye contact with these dolphin and I start think how smart be these fuck thing because we be fishing dolphin eat fish but you never catch dolphin ever no one have ever go fishing and accidentally catch a dolphin and all I could think of while these dolphin be like hop through the water and look at we and shit  I be think if people live in the water you would

yank up to the cloud fuck we lose billy the bottom of his sneaker in a puff of cloud you do not catch dolphin on fishhook man that be weird they be around fish all the time and like bitch they be fuck smart how smart well I watch a dolphin documentary and it say they have a cerebral cortex that be   large than a human being  I do not know what that mean but if you say it right and do not fuck up the word it make you sound smart than you really be I think what it mean be they have big fuck brain but we do not think of they as be smart cause they do not do what we do right they do not send email they do not have house but if you live in their world you do not need anything you do not need your finger no one be type they have a language that be so complex we ca not understand it all the food  free they stay where the water  warm I start think how fuck smart be they what if they be exactly the same as we what if it be just some different branch of evolution we go one way they go the other what if consciousness be the same I be think what if I to I be the same as I to a dolphin the way you think of yourself when you say the word I I be like what if that be exactly how a dolphin feel they be just live life through different biology different genetic different life experience but if I live a dolphin  life I would be he and if he live my life he would be I and then I start think what if that be the case with people what if everyone be exactly the same we be just live life through different body what if that be the secret of happiness treat everyone as if it be you live another life   I mean  and then I think god damn how good be this weed I be get in california whoo I be on a fuck float craft out in the middle of the ocean talk to water people the problem with treat

there be some grand conspiracy there be some cabal of evil genius that be pull the string on everyone in america it be most likely that people be just dumb as fuck in all sort of walk of life this be the story this be the real story about the person who break into the white house first of all people be always worried the government  check out my email bro the government be watch we all the time they pull this guy over two month before he break into the white house he have four handgun two rifle and a machete with he they do not even watch he he have a map on the map be washington and it have an x where the white house be they be like you be good to go they let he go two month later this motherfucker break into the white house and why do he break into the white house why do you break into the white house ever because you want to die you do not  that be like a suicide run that be the only reason why someone run toward the white house if you have to ask someone what kind of security do you think they have at the white house oh dude  they get sniper on every corner they get laser in the grass if you get too far they open up a door you drop right into jail nope turn out they do not

of those fuck thing freakin  out shit   probably think why the fuck do I do this I think the guy who break into the white house and obama probably have a lot in common in that  they go for it but they probably never really think they be get in there you ca not quit once you be the president the moment obama actually get into office like good morning mr president he be probably like oh no what the fuck do I do this for I do not think I be actually gon na get in   I ca not sleep I be freak out everybody want to kill I   who the fuck be guard I look out in the hallway there be a girl take selfie

heaven that be what we do and that be what that be that be a metal dick it be a robot dick and we be try to fuck the sky we be literally try to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planet our ultimate goal be that we get those planet pregnant and they be too fill up with people and then they get ta make a new metal dick bro we get ta go to jupiter then they make another one they shoot that fuck thing and they fill jupiter up we just keep fill the cosmo up with people and we never evolve and we never change we stay perfect like we be right now who be in you be gon na all come with I we be gon na leave here right now and go to the church of scientology right down the street and it be all gon na make sense when you find out that you be an eternal being that create reality so that you can enjoy it I watch that hbo documentary a couple too many time I go clear I think I think I be clear I be back I be back now if you have not see    I have to watch go clear a scientology documentary cause I have a neighbor who be a scientologist and I do not even think he be gay I do not know what the fuck be go on   but he sleep really close to I you know like my bed be here this fuck dude  bed be like over there his house be  I mean if you take away the wall he be fuck right there it be like what do this crazy fuck believe and scientology be a wonderful religion not just because it be write by a science fiction author who write more fake shit than anyone that be ever walk the face of the earth and not by a small amount this dude never make a second draft in his fuck life everything be one draft of nonsense and he write more of it than anybody not in his neighborhood not in his state not in a year not in a decade more than anyone that be ever live ever and scientology be still like I do not see any red flag I think we be good I think this be legit as fuck if scientology be a good religion it be because other religion get to make fun of em it be like it be the one religion that even the mormon be like bitch you believe what hold on I mean at least we do not have video of joseph smith there be some fuck shitty black and white footage of l ron hubbard with a captain  outfit on you wanna explain that   why do he have all those award on why be tom cruise wear a gold medal the size of a dinner plate what the fuck be go on with you people I watch it with my mom and it be like  first of all scientology they do not pay taxis that be disturb they be taxfree which mean they be a recognize religion by the government of the united state which mean the government of the united state have to go over what they believe and go everything seem in order none of this shit seem like a cult well what the fuck be a cult and what be a religion so I have to look it up turn out  I do not know who write this but it be a perfect definition a cult be bullshit it be create by one person that person know it be bullshit in a religion that dude  dead so it be a religion cause l ron hubbard  dead so I guess they get it on a loophole I watch it with my mom and my mom be like I ca not believe anybody would fall for that you make I go to catholic school the fuck be you talk about there be a child molester dress like a sorcerer sit on a golden throne and you make I call he father slow your roll lady imagine if I talk to my mom like that oh my god joke folk just joke I do not have a problem with people be religious because I just think life itself be too openende it be too confusing and I think we be evolve and part of our struggle in evolve be unanswered question we wanna seek these answer but in the meanwhile they just give you so much anxiety and it fuck with you so much there be nothing wrong with join a cult I think you got ta just join a nice friendly one like the mormon be a good cult here be why they do not get mad at anybody like they never kill anybody like here be a perfect example matt stone and trey parker the guy who create south park they make a hilarious musical call the book of mormon it be fantastic if you have not see it it be so fuck hilarious but it be also brutal brutal about the mormon you know what the mormon do they go to see it and they take out a fullpage ad in the playbill it say if you enjoy this musical and you wanna find out more about be a mormon please visit our website they just take it right on the chin like champ they do not get mad they do not get defensive they do not kill anybody that be a good cult they just say what do you wanna do we get nine wife shut the fuck up everybody just  everybody just chill just chill that be a good religion that be a good cult some cult be not that good they get fuck testy you know the one we do not have to say who you know what I be talk about there be that one that will kill you if you draw their guy come on man I ca not even draw your dude what if I draw a dude draw your dude no loophole fuckin  relax bro and this be not just theoretical people have die cause they make cartoon before the most recent paris attack there be a magazine call charlie hebdo and they be attack where   cartoonist be kill eleven more be wound and they kill a cop too fuck crazy over cartoon and when you  when there be radical crazy people in the world what be interesting be the reaction to radical crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balance itself out when thing get weird because when these people got kill over a cartoon the whole world be in shock the whole world be outraged but one of the scary thing about it be nobody want to print those picture you could not see em in the la time you could not find they in time magazine you have to go online and find they it be a dark moment for free speech because everybody be like oh I do not wanna get kill I do not wanna show the picture it be weird until  the balance because after they got kill and nobody want to print the picture word get back to texas  where they promptly hold a draw muhammad contest in garland texas I be not make a word of this up you can google it and I will wait they have a draw muhammad contest in garland texas two dude show up start shoot at the building they be kill almost instantly why because they be at a draw muhammad contest in texas how obvious do a trap have to be before you start get suspicious what be you livin  in a wile e coyote cartoon motherfucker you ever go to texas that be not santa monica bitch that be a totally different kind of white people those be some wild west people that have computer and modern gun they be not suppose to be there people do not evolve in texas it be not like they be monkey then they become people and they stay in that spot no no they land on boat on the east coast the stubborn one stay the smart one make it to california but along the way we lose a bunch of people   and some of they just stick around y all go ahead we be gon na hang back here I be gon na draw the big dick the world  ever see in the sand my wife  get the big titty imma try to fuck a snake I think it can be do they just stay they just gather cattle stockpile ammo and they all talk alike and that be why you got ta be nervous you got ta be nervous in place with accent okay it be one of the reason why I can prove that california be the good spot to live  cause all the spot that suck they all have to sound like each other  cause I grow up in a place like that I grow up in boston it be not that the people in boston suck but the weather suck it be fuck horrible and in the winter everybody get in their car in the morning and just go fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck and everybody be worried about  it be a real possibility you might starve to death one day you might freeze try to walk home   so they all talk in the same way oh my god how many more month till summer ahhh when be this fuck winter gon na be over we need more firewood   they have to sound like the people around they so if other people invade like we stick together we be all in this together that be how they be in texas too they be like y all ai not from around here be ya they have a fuck certain way of talk which be proof positive why california be the good spot try make fun of a california accent what be you gon na do speak clear and concise what be you gon na do you gon na mock we you be gon na say some shit that everybody understand they be not suppose to be in texas folk it be not even a state it be a republic they be like man we ai not so sure about this whole united state thing we be gon na hang back hang back see how this play out they do not have any rule they have like three page of rule book here be how I know this I be gon na tell you a fact a fact about texas that will change the way you think about texas there be more tiger in captivity in texas in private collection than there be in all of the wild of the world I be gon na repeat it because I know you be like oh the fear factor guy be just make shit up to make his joke work no there be more tiger in dude  yard in texas than the rest of the fuck planet how be that possible because they can because they go through the rule book    it do not say shit about tiger order it up dude order it up dude one guy get a tiger and his neighbor  like shit I do not know we could get tiger and he get two tiger and the first guy be like I ai not about to let this faggot outtiger I and he open up tiger world with his oil money we be gon na need those people folk if the russian invade we ca not make fuck warrior baby with those chick in marin county with

chris kyle rest in peace when you make em come we need those woman if the russian come we got ta be ready think about the child think about the child while I get a sip this be super important lady and gentleman a lot of people be sleep on    imagine if I have real point oh jesus christ   I love you fucker too man so excited to be here   I have kid and I lie to they I get high around em too people say you should not do that but they do not see it they say you should not be intoxicate around your child well I be not I be high I call it elevate it be a different thing the people who have a problem with that they do not understand what get high be like they think you be gon na be to your kid like who be you what do you think what be the bad thing that can happen if I be a little high around my kid they be gon na get extra hug and daddy be go to be paranoid about object look out do not go there that be it plus I have cool conversation I have a sixyearold daughter man there be not a lot of yearold man and yearold girl have in common other than the fact she be my daughter and so our conversation be normally pretty boring but when I be high I be like you know you call that thing your baby your doll you call it your baby but you know it be not a baby right yeah I know it be not a baby do you call it a baby because you be the young and you like have someone who be responsible for you maybe okay that be cool that be cool give I a hug I love you   it be weird man it be weird raise little people there be some thing that I do not expect one of the thing I do not expect be you have to lie to they like you do not have to lie to they about a lot of thing but you have to lie to they about santa claus it be just one of those thing man cause it be like a community you have to think about what your kid be gon na tell other kid because when it come to santa claus you do not want your kid to be one of two thing you do not want your kid to be the first kid that tell everyone that santa claus be bullshit cause that kid be an asshole but you do not want your kid to be the last kid that figure out that santa claus be bullshit cause that kid be a moron so you get  you get a little bit of  you be like oh no when do we do this when do we do this and no one know when to do it you just let the kid figure it out then they be like dad what the fuck you be like aw  oh I miss the boat I miss the boat nobody know when to do it nobody can be honest about it they have little meeting and shit and I be like when do we tell em this lady go when they be   they be gon na be fuck by then I tell she it be funny she do not believe I I be like oh I be sorry I be off by a year that be not as funny but it be  I do not mean it but it be this thing they want to keep the kid in the dark and they wanna pretend they be the only one that be teach the kid this be a weird thing that people do they be like I teach my kid man I teach my kid eh  when you see em but unless you be some freak who homeschool your child in the forest your kid be gon na go to school they be gon na go to school and they be gon na be in a class with   other kid the teacher only make   buck a year and she be think about dick that be all she be think about she be think about getting stuff she be a young fertile woman who love kid and she be write on that chalkboard and the kid all huddle up and share information like yeah what do your dad tell you your dad tell you that yeah my dad say santa claus be fuck bullshit okay you ever go near a chimney it be that big what the fuck teacher  come play with

human they wanna run shit who be these people tell we what to do be they be straight with we man what the fuck be go on I know the day my daughter know that santa claus be bullshit she come home stare I down she be like maddogge I she take her book bag and just go    walk right up to the chimney look at I how the fuck dad have you ever meet santa claus no honey I ve never meet he but you let he in the house and there be this moment  it be a moment where a sevenyearold have you at checkmate you be like oh shit I do not know whether to highfive she or to keep lie you wanna go yeah you get I you get I you get I that be bullshit no the big bang be real but this be bullshit the big bang sound even less real the problem be you have to be consistent if you be teach your kid nonsense you got ta teach em only nonsense you ca not mix nonsense in with like real stuff like my daughter will go like how do bird fly I go bird have bone that be hollow so they be really light then they have feather which cover a large surface area and they use the hollow bone and the feather to push down on the air see the air look like it be nothing right but it be actually a bunch of gas that be why the tree move when the wind blow the bird can manipulate that and go through d space whoa yeah nature be crazy yeah how do the fat man get through the little hole magic christmas magic now go to bed I be try to fuck your mom go to bed   joke folk just joke ca not talk like that that be how you make stripper you got ta be nice they be little tiny people they be adorable they do not know anything yet you got ta teach em everything you ca not talk mean   kid be a lot like really fuck stupid people  in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room the most confident one just start run shit they do not have to have any more information they just have to be more confident if you get a bunch of dummy together they be like I do not know what be go on I do not know what be go on i fuck do I fuck do the guy do not have to have any extra datum he just have to be the only one that be confident and that be what it be like in school my daughter  class have this fuck kid name debbie and every day it be debbie say  oh fuck debbie say debbie say what you do not think about that before you have kid not only be you gon na have kid but your kid be gon na make friend and then you have to make friend with the fuck parent of your kid and some of em be crazy my daughter  like debbie say adam and eve be the only two people in the world and all people come from they be that true   and this be weird like you do not know what to do right you want to be diplomatic you do not want to cause problem at school but you got ta be honest and one of the most difficult thing to say to a kid be I do not know I be like sweetie I do not know I do not know if adam and eve be where people come from but nobody know because no one from today be alive back then so it be not something you can measure so it be not something you can see so we do not know but here be what we do know you know how some people have big ear and some people have little ear yeah well some people have brain that be make out of dog shit and they get horny too and what happen be they have to find someone even dumb than they to have sex with it be like the opposite of evolution and then they have a kid and their kid be fuck their kid be fuck and everybody want to pretend it be a level playing field there be no level anywhere you look be an eagle and a salmon level do the salmon ever get to eat the eagle no the universe do not want even it want conflict and resolution and constant improvement okay I be gon na shut this light out and I be gon na go fuck your mom right in the mouth all right I do not say these thing I do not say any of these thing I be like I do not know maybe debbie  right do not make sense to I how would that work how would that work it would not work would it adam and eve be the only two people they have kid and then where do all the other people come from I guess the kid just start fuck each other be that what happen mom fuck the kid or the  yeah exactly debbie  parent they be at my house man for a cookout and the dude tell I the earth    year old they be young earth christian they be sweet people by the way before I shit on they  I be gon na shit on they but before I shit on they they be sweet they be really nice people I hug em every time I see em they be really kind nice people but they just find a part of their brain they be like I have no use for this   chuck that whole logic discerningreason part this fuck thing  confusing they be young earth christian which mean they follow the strict interpretation of the bible possible I be like how many people believe the earth be less than   year old uh I look it up there be a recent gallup poll that say that   of america believe the earth be less than   year old   here be why you should not be scared they can only measure people dumb enough to answer poll and when you factor that in you be talk about a really small number  cause you know what the average response be if you call people up and say how old be the earth number one answer be old than your mother  pussy and then they hang up number two answer be fuck you after that you start throw number around and only   of those dummy be stupid enough to think the earth be   year old that be debbie  fuck parent so out of the people that answer poll  be it even   it might be   only   be that fuck stupid and that be the   we should really be worried about we be worried about the wrong   not that we should not be worried about the really rich greedy people we definitely should we should definitely worry about banker and people who  they be just stockpile resource they could help the world in some really impossible way for anybody else but they do not they would rather just pile up their gold   yeah that   be awful but there be another   that freak I the fuck out that no one be talk about that be the   who leave comment on youtube video who the fuck be those freak could you imagine people talk to each other like that in real life and not beat the shit out of each other I mean if jesus christ himself come back from the dead and have a youtube page the first comment would be you ai not shit without your dad pussy these be monster this be not a normal person  response normal people do not leave comment what a normal person do they watch a video they like it or they do not like it that be it it end right there but what you be deal with be the process of racism and child abuse and neglect and shitty gene and the insane clown posse be play they know all the word and they be waft up their fart and their cheez doodle finger and like an open letter to jennifer lopez  let I pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick here   ugh  dear jennifer do not you think it be about time you dress a little more classy what be your child gon na see
